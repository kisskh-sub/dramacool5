00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.560
Lord Zhang often praised Bingyi.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.590
He wished to marry his granddaughter to him.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.250
But his brother, Zhang Anshi, stopped him.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.680
He said,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.310
Bingyi is the son of Crown Prince Wei.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.050
Being able to live as a commoner

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.280
is already a blessing for him.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.920
Do not speak of marriage again.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.120
But as fate would have it,

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.000
your daughter Xu Pingjun was to be wed,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.920
yet the marriage never happened.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.220
With Lord Zhang as matchmaker,

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.400
in Yuanfeng Year 6,

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.790
Bingyi and Pingjun were wed.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.630
Lord Wang,

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.140
you've never been to Chang'an,

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.840
so how do you know about all this?

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.070
I simply know what I know.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.480
It's the Mandate of Heaven.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.590
Do you recall when your wife brought

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.960
Pingjun to seek a divination?

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.480
Wasn't it said she'd have great fortune?

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.630
I never told anyone of this matter.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.710
I know what you know

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:16.440
and even

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.620
what you shouldn't know.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.710
Now the chance stands before you.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:20.910
Remove Huo Guang from power,

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.910
and the Wucheng Village will be well treated.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.360
Then Pingjun will live a good life,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.390
and of course, Bingyi as well.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.910
He will be granted
a fief and a royal title.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.240
Lord Zhang's spirit in heaven

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.450
will surely be pleased to see all this.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.520
After so many years,

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.840
Crown Prince Wei's wrongful fate

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.520
can finally be set right.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.190
Lord Zhang's hopes for Bingyi

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.520
should now be fulfilled.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.120
Lord Wang,

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.870
I will pass the message along.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.240
Please, return now.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.360
Lord Xu, I shall take my leave.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.550
It seems,

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.190
that the Qi Chang I met
in Wucheng Village

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.280
was the Crown Prince Liu He,

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.960
my own uncle.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.240
This Wang Heng

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.360
is truly a man touched by the divine.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.200
Mandate of Heaven...

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.910
How intriguing.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.400
Tomorrow,

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.000
I'll head to Wucheng Village.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.860
Bingyi.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.800
Are you serious?

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.370
For the sake of Grandfather,

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.680
everyone's suffered just to keep me safe.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.910
I want to do something for all of you.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.590
(Thankfully, my ex is a tour guide)

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.960
(of the Han Dynasty Museum.)

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.030
(At least I still remember that much.)

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.120
What matters now is

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.600
to come up with a new plan.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.280
How could we make Huo Guang agree

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.600
to let me lead a large group
out of the city?

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.490
Forget it.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:12.590
Let's call it a day.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.310
I'll go rest now.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.780
I have to oversee
the funeral ceremony tomorrow.

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.840
Have you memorized all the formalities?

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.960
Yes, I've got them all down.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.910
Don't worry, you should also rest early.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.100
(74 BC,)

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.800
(Duke of Changyi,
already named Crown Prince,)

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.550
(presided over
the grand funeral of Liu Fuling)

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.020
(the eighth Emperor of Western Han Dynasty,)

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.590
(at Pingling, 70 li northwest of Chang'an.)

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:46.630
Lord Huo,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.160
I've yet

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.670
to inherit the throne.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.220
It's not proper to reside in the Palace.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.560
This is my filial respect
to the Late Emperor.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.600
Today, you observed every courtesy,

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.630
leaving nothing amiss.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.090
The bearing of an Emperor is taking shape.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.040
Good.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.560
There are still two ceremonies ahead.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.270
Hope you'll diligently practice the rites

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.430
and strive for perfection.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.310
You've worked hard today.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.950
Rest early.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.070
I shall take my leave now.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.000
Lord Huo.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.730
There is one more favor.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:26.470
Oh?

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.270
Earlier at Weiyang Palace,

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.480
upon seeing the Late Emperor's coffin,

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.310
I felt great grief.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.880
The sight brought sorrow anew.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.820
It made me realize I haven't

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.390
paid my respects
to my grandfather, Emperor Wu.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.410
I truly feel deep shame for this.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.510
Moreover, Emperor Wu

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.590
is also the role model for Changyi people.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.070
Our admiration for him is beyond words.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.010
You're so understanding and virtuous,

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.570
truly a mark of filial rule.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.700
This is all thanks to having wise ministers

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.160
like Lord Gong to guide you.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.880
You have worked hard.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.480
You flatter me, Lord Huo.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.680
Assisting the Duke is simply my duty.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:15.630
Lord Huo.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.050
About our plan to pay respects,

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.320
can it be carried out?

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.260
You show the utmost virtue
and filial piety.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.480
I did not think it through carefully

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.160
and failed to make proper arrangements.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:27.670
Indeed,

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.010
Emperor Wu was the foundation
of our dynasty.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.360
As his heir to the throne,

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.680
you should pay your respects

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.830
to show your filial devotion.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.630
It is only right to do so.

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.350
Very well.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.630
Then I shall take my leave, Duke.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.000
Thank you, Great General.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:57.180
(Duke of Changyi's Mansion)

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.830
Brilliant.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:12.670
Oh,

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.510
just a small clever move.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.480
Nothing worth mentioning.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.310
What did Huo Guang say?

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.870
"Duke, you've shown

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.160
the utmost virtue and filial piety.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.850
I did not think it through carefully

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.800
and failed to make proper arrangements.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.750
Indeed, Emperor Xiaowu…"

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.510
- Oh, everyone's here.
- Lord Gong.

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.880
I brought some fruit for Lord Wang.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.660
You can share it together.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:47.760
Ah, many thanks, Lord Gong.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
My pleasure.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:57.070
Back to the topic.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:59.590
Huo Guang will inspect the armies tomorrow.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.750
I'll be there with the other generals.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.290
I'll take this opportunity

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.210
to proceed with our plan
to switch the men.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.950
A word from my martial uncle,

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:07.950
everything is ready.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:09.600
Tomorrow, we act as planned.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.310
They'll replace your men
and enter the Palace.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.240
The day after tomorrow
is the military meeting.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:16.950
We stick to the original plan.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:18.600
Seize Huo Guang in the passageway.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:19.840
Mm.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.950
Upon your signal,

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:22.230
I'll take down Huo Guang,

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.240
then go to the armory.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.000
Cut their reinforcements off completely.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:25.840
Alright.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.160
I'll have the Empress Dowager set out early

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.000
to Chengming Hall.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:31.240
Once you've caught Huo Guang,

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.080
she'll condemn him.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.110
Good.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.150
It's a perfect chance.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:35.840
Act in one decisive strike.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.280
Let's do this.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:43.550
In my hometown,

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:44.750
we place our hands together

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.960
and shout out: Go for it.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.510
It means when together,

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:48.710
we're unstoppable.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.000
What does "go for it" mean?

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:53.840
To lift our spirits.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.560
Come on.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.440
Follow my lead.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.960
One, two, three.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:09.080
- Go for it!
- Go for it!

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:11.430
Alright.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:12.790
You have heavy duties ahead.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.390
So rest early tonight.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.360
Time to sleep.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.260
(Nine)

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.160
I strained my neck?

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:23.000
- Lord Wang.
- Coming.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000
I'll go over myself.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:26.350
Please.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:37.030
Lord Wang,

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:38.350
you're up so early.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:41.750
Of course.

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:43.750
Morning, Lord Huo.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.840
You... what happened there?

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.000
Reporting to milord,

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.730
I woke up with a stiff neck.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.120
Oh.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:52.960
Lord Huo,

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.080
after you.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.790
Go ahead.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.320
Go on.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:10.440
Go on.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.440
Same as always.

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:26.630
Good morning, generals.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.190
- General Zhang, General Fan.
- Morning.

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.110
General Han, General Zhao.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:33.600
Morning, generals.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:34.470
You...

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:41.770
- Come on.
- (What's going on?)

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:42.750
Everyone, have a seat.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.080
(They don't seem to know me.)

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.200
Come on.

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:47.510
Sit.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.280
Generals,

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.390
the Late Emperor's burial is at hand.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:01.500
The New Sovereign is to
ascend the throne.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.810
- We must tighten
- (Why is it)

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:04.410
- the guards.
- (the same as before?)

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:05.490
(Just like the first day.)

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:06.600
(Wrong memory?)

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.220
The first matter is

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:12.600
the defense arrangements
for the Duke's entry.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.000
I propose our elite troops be split

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.480
into inner and outer groups.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.000
The outer one patrols around the city.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.820
- The other guards the city.
- (I'm not dead.)

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.140
(Where did it all go wrong?)

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.550
I will also set up covert sentries

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.200
to handle sudden incidents.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:27.240
I propose to survey the route in advance

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.630
and clear all obstacles along the way.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.630
Ensure the roads remain unimpeded.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.030
In my humble opinion,

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.370
we should send a scout team
to lead the way

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:37.750
and sweep for potential threats.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:41.000
(Five, four, three, two, one.)

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:42.960
Please continue.

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:44.440
I'll be right back.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.620
Wait a moment, Lord Huo.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.360
Today,

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.440
aren't we heading to inspect the Armies?

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.990
Dead...

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.750
How exactly did I die?

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:06.200
The first matter is the defense...

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.560
Greetings, I'm Yan Yannian.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.650
The Duke of Changyi has arrived.
Before the funeral,

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:12.120
eat well and take care of your health.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.770
Who can keep you safe when I'm not here?

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.080
Heng,

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:18.600
aren't we doing it?

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:19.960
Mm.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:21.680
Alright.

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:24.230
Go for it!

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:25.510
Get some sleep.

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:26.350
Let's go.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.260
(Nine)

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.080
Lord Gong.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.600
Instead of assisting the Duke

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.240
to uphold the way of a sovereign,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.860
you let the Duke risk himself in danger.

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:41.660
Thus you cannot come and go freely,

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.910
nor drink and enjoy yourself as before.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:45.350
Lord Wang.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.360
Huo Guang will inspect the Armies tomorrow.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.480
I'll be there with the other generals.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.280
- Lord Gong.
- All here.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:56.920
I brought some fruit to Lord Wang.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.270
You can share it.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.160
Lord Gong.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.390
It's a misunderstanding.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.950
I will see you knave executed.

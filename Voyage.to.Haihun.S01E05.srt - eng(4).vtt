00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.700
How much are you
selling this ticket for?

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:32.640
Twice

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:33.760
the original price.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.810
That's steep.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.070
This is a VVIP ticket.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.920
It lets you stand high

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.310
to share the thrill of departure
and victory with the Duke.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.950
Only a select few can be up there.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.760
I took huge risks to get it.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.920
This is already a bargain.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.790
And it's the last one left.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.040
You booked 30 horses
and still couldn't get a ticket?

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.640
I'll take this ticket.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.200
Sorry.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.000
The ticket is gone.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.030
Come on, leave.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.030
I told you to buy earlier.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.680
Not bad, young man.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.280
All thanks to your guidance.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.400
I have a question for you.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.560
I'm not deceiving the Duke.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.960
I'm the event organizer.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.370
Holding back premium tickets
for scalpers is common practice.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.810
I just want to ask.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.590
I help you sell tickets.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.470
Why call me a scalper?

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.120
Well.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.960
Your scalp

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.120
looks good,

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.130
and you work well for me.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.580
So, you're a scalper.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.430
Understood.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.520
Then I'll be called Scalp Wang.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.360
What?

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.190
(Scalp Wang)
I grew up without a name.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.120
It's my greatest honor
to take your surname.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.400
Well.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.440
Anyway, helping me sell tickets
stays between us.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.240
No one else can know.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.110
Do you understand?

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.980
Of course.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.360
No one knows except my brother.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:11.630
Your brother?

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:12.550
Yes.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.150
My brother and I have had no parents.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.990
We've depended on each other to survive.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.360
You've given us clothes to wear,

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.490
food to eat,

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.490
and even some money.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.550
Rest assured.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.170
We will never betray you.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.090
Hey, little brother.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.010
My brother's here.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.000
He's your brother?

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.150
Yes, he's my brother.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.590
He's too old to be your brother.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.910
I can hardly believe it.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.610
He's looked like this
since he was eight.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.650
Ha ha ha.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.770
I didn't expect to see Lord Wang here.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.030
Brother.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.120
I have a name now.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.470
I took the master's surname.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:46.810
I'm called Scalp Wang.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.370
That's a fine name.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.220
I'll take the surname Wang, too.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.120
(Horse Wang)
I'll be Horse Wang.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.310
Why don't you two pick different names?

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.960
We're to serve you.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.080
We're not changing names.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.940
Don't.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.030
You're making me look
like a slave owner.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.520
How about this?

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.200
From this day on,

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.750
I'll be your personal VVIP.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.310
The race is tomorrow.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.340
Give it your best shot.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.170
- Alright.
- Got it.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.080
It's finally starting.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.040
We almost missed it.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.320
- I know, right?
- How lively.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.660
(Changyi)

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.860
(Li's Pastries, Li's Rouge)

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.020
(Li, Official Sponsor)

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.860
(Li's Pastries)

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.680
(Li's Fine Tea)

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.300
(Shuyue Books)

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.140
(Changyi Li)

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.090
Alright, ladies.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.400
Please, upstairs.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.990
They're from the Western Regions?

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.480
It proves the influence
of our equine administration.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.720
Once it becomes
an annual cultural festival,

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.630
the food and lodging in Changyi,

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.660
along with travel,
can all raise their prices.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.030
This is called

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.720
Equine Administration Cultural Tourism.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.500
I don't get it.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.410
(As if you ever would.)

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.510
The race is about to start.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:00.380
Hurry and get ready.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.270
Mm.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.020
Great!

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.040
Riders, take your positions.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.160
Ready.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.390
Go, go, go!

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.230
Three.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.440
Two.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.320
One.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:15.350
Go!

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.320
Hyah!

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.710
Hyah!

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.270
After all the bond we've built,

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.800
how can you falter now?

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.310
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.560
Hyah!

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.510
What a fine-looking horse!

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.300
Hey, everyone!

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.240
In this equestrian match,

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.630
the top three winners

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.520
will not only earn a handsome reward

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.750
but also face off
against a mystery rider.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.100
Let's wait and see!

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:56.870
Hyah!

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.240
Look, here they come!

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.960
Hyah!

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:01.760
First place goes

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.720
to Xu Qingge!

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.270
Well done!

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.010
- Hurry!
- Good!

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.880
Hyah!

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.560
Hurry up! Aren't you embarrassed?

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.950
Come on, faster!

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.560
Ah!

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:22.950
Brother!

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.020
(Li Nvxu)

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.880
(What's going on?)

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.120
Brother!

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.960
(Again?)

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.420
(11th day of the 6th month, 74 BC)

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.500
(10th day of the 6th month, 74 BC)

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.190
Riders, take your positions.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.070
Three.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:53.260
Two.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.510
One.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.950
Go!

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.360
What happened?

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.120
What's going on?

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.680
Lord Wang!

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.630
What's the matter?

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.720
Wake up! Lord Wang!

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.060
(Qingge Tavern)

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.910
Heng.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.760
Heng!

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:17.440
Heng, wake up.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:20.750
See? I told you not to train so hard.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.390
Now, you've passed out.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:23.460
Someone's after your life.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.920
- Wait.
- Step aside.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.020
Who dares to kill me here?

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:28.090
Wang Heng, I'm telling you.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.000
Wang Heng!

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.180
What's with that attitude?

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.310
Can't you hear me?

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.340
I'm trying to protect you.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.200
Step aside.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:34.510
Wang Heng, stop!

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.390
I can't stand it
when people don't answer me.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.240
I did answer.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.600
Oh? Then tell me what I just asked.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.510
It doesn't matter.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:42.510
Life comes first.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:43.750
Hurry to the finish line.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:44.920
Qingge is going to win.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:45.830
Qingge?

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:46.670
Believe it or not.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:47.990
Qingge can claim the first place?

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.630
Wang, your ticket.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.600
I'm already your VVIP.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.610
Why would I need a ticket?

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.520
Step aside.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.300
Have you seen a Western Regions girl?

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.320
No.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.850
Have you seen a Western Regions girl?

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.050
I think she was here just now.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.600
Wang Heng.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.720
Are you deaf or something?

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.680
Stay put by the guards.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.000
Just do as I say.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:13.840
Wang Heng.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.430
Here they come.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.550
She's riding so fast.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.630
First place!

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.290
Qingge.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:21.800
This round's champion.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:23.720
The winner is

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.600
Xu Qingge!

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.120
Wang Heng called it right.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:30.820
Hey.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.350
Where did the Western Regions girl go?

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.660
She headed that way.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.020
(Qingge Tavern)

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.150
Hey.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.000
Isn't that the rich young lady

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:55.630
who bought the VVIP ticket?

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.030
So, that's the kind of girl you like.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:00.180
She's the one who wants you dead.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.320
I'm an honest, upright man.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.260
I do good deeds.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.320
I have no enemies.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:10.630
Who'd want to kill me?

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.560
Humph.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.950
Do you even believe that yourself?

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.120
Even if you doubt it, I believe in it.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.360
Enough with the pointless talk.

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:18.720
Did you find it or not?

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:19.960
Of course, I did.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:21.460
You like her, after all.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.910
Are you asking for a beating?

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.510
Everything you asked for
has been taken care of.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.020
But what we should do right now

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.670
is celebrate Qingge's victory.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:33.910
I emptied the whole wine cellar

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:34.920
just to find this bottle.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.390
- Duke.
- It has quite a history.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:37.750
- Melon.
- Oh, my.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.030
Fine wine indeed.

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:40.790
At this very moment,

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.440
in a setting like this,

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.600
it's perfect to open
this bottle of Jiuyun Wine

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:47.030
from the Era of Tianhan.

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:48.270
The Era of Tianhan?

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.150
That's something

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:52.010
like a Lafite

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.940
from '82.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:55.870
Lafite?

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.940
A Lafite from '82?

00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.990
Oh.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.080
It means

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.360
it's precious.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:02.750
Oh.

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:04.020
The year '82.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.040
Very rare.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.480
Go ask your father

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.020
- if he has any '82 medicine.
- Spare me!

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:17.550
Li Qi, pay up.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.720
- Stop hitting me, help!
- Pay up.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.120
Hey, Heng.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:29.270
Weren't you just leaving?

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:30.470
Why are you back?

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.030
We need to talk.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.120
What's the matter?

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.860
At your race tomorrow,

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:36.480
put on this outfit.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.840
Didn't I faint today?

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:40.690
How can I still join the finals?

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.390
Because you are the mystery rider.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:43.990
Me?

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:45.890
I've thought about it for a long time

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.330
and only came up with this plan.

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:48.680
You want to meet the Duke, right?

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.030
But you'll be sent in as the organizer.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.330
Otherwise, you would've been eliminated.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.590
How would you meet the Duke?

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.000
You really thought it through.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:05.230
Close the door.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:06.230
Alright.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:08.820
Heng, give it your all tomorrow.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.140
Come on.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:22.150
Have you seen him before?

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.870
- No.
- Good.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.680
Give it your all.

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:27.680
They're in the finals.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:42.360
Miss Xu.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.120
(The mystery rider
representing the organizer.)

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.390
(What an impressive scene.)

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:48.200
(Liu He is just so-so.)

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.500
(I wonder where he is watching from.)

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:02.960
(I must give my very best.)

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:04.360
The first "Changyi Riders"

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.960
"Racing with the Wind".

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:07.870
The finals

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.980
begin now.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:14.840
Riders, take your positions.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:15.910
Come on!

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:17.550
Secure your saddles.

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:22.240
Sound the drum thrice.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.040
Three.

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:27.510
Two.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.730
One.

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:34.300
Begin!

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:36.990
- Charge!
- Got it!

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.270
Hyah!

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:44.430
Run!

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.440
Wait. Where's the Duke?

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.840
I saw him before the race started.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:53.340
Hyah!

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:55.840
Hyah!

00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:59.510
Hyah!

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.080
Your plan is truly brilliant.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.030
I finally understand
why you seemed distant

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:12.910
and aloof before.

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:14.720
So, you trust me the most.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.080
We're out. Can you be quiet now?

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.120
Shut your mouth.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.120
I'm excited.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.390
I'm not as free as you.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.080
Someone's always watching me.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.390
I don't like being watched over.

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:29.720
I'm no royalty or nobility

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:32.850
who grew up in comfort and luxury.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:36.850
Commoners like us

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.750
take life's beatings day after day.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:43.840
I am Wang Heng.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.240
A pleasure working with you.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.390
When you climbed the wall,

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.220
you finally looked like an Immortal.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.840
With so much money beside me,

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:51.960
I could rest in peace with a smile.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.600
You must've fallen from the heavens.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:56.390
Aren't you an Immortal?

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:57.720
How could you not foresee this?

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.080
I'm just indulging you out of joy.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:00.910
We'll slip away from Changyi,

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:01.950
ride together to Chang'an,

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:02.700
reclaim the Qilin,

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.810
and see our wish fulfilled.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:04.910
Wouldn't that be thrilling?

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.700
Great!

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:11.430
Whoa.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:15.780
Wait for me here.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.510
Duke, where are you going?

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:27.510
Run!

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:28.390
Come on!

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:29.480
So fast!

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.360
Run!

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:33.270
Hyah! Hyah!

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:37.620
What mystery rider?

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.120
Look at the decorations on that horse.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:39.970
It's the Duke.

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:41.080
It's pretty obvious.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:41.900
Let's give him way.

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:42.920
Let him have his moment.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.150
His pace is far too slow.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:45.630
Going slow is so hard.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.080
And I have to make it look natural.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:47.840
Nothing we can do.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.930
He is the Duke, after all.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.840
Just bear with it.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.440
Hyah!

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:52.910
Hyah! Hyah!

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:02.960
Here they come.

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:04.320
The first place has arrived.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.590
Good.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:09.630
Alright, everyone, let's cheer together.

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:12.030
(As the organizer's rider,)

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:12.960
(I cheated,)

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:15.150
(but the rivals were too obvious.)

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.550
(It was still all about connections.)

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:20.440
Good.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.030
Let's congratulate

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:26.210
the champion of today's race,

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:27.240
Duke of Changyi,

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.840
His Highness Liu He.

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:30.730
(Duke of Changyi?)

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:33.390
Duke of Changyi.

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:34.560
Duke of Changyi!

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:35.950
Duke of Changyi.

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:37.160
Duke of Changyi!

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:38.270
Duke of Changyi.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.290
Duke of Changyi!

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:41.060
Duke of Changyi.

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.220
The imperial decree is here.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:55.480
Where is the Duke?

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:56.910
This is not the Duke.

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:58.080
What should we do?

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:00.120
For now, keep this quiet.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:04.000
Duke of Changyi,

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:05.100
Liu He, receive the decree.

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:06.670
(The imperial decree is here.)

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.670
Liu He, Duke of Changyi,
is summoned to the capital.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:23.920
Lord Shi.

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:25.750
This is of great importance.

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:29.550
Accepting it here
might seem lacking in decorum.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.750
Please allow us to return

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:33.750
to the Changyi Palace

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.750
for the Acceptance Ceremony.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:36.710
Well.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.800
That works.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.480
(It seems His Majesty has passed.)

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:40.510
(Where is Liu He?)

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.710
(He must be scared out of his wits.)

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:46.030
(It's good for him to be the Emperor.)

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:47.470
(See you next time.)

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:48.510
Hyah!

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.390
The Duke has likely fled.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:57.250
Hurry.

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:58.850
Find someone and bring him back at once.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.720
Or the consequences
will be unimaginable.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:02.960
Yes.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.240
You, go as well.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.080
Yes.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:08.000
No sign of the Duke
in the east of the city.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:08.880
Nor in the south.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.980
We've searched the entire race route
for the day.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.030
No news so far.

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:14.720
Search again.

00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:15.910
Yes.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:18.800
Milord.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.030
The Chang'an Envoy
has been properly arranged.

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:22.460
But the imperial decree is pressing.

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:23.750
The time must not be delayed.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:25.750
The Duke should go at once
to accept the decree.

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:30.720
In that case,

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.030
go and tell them

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:33.030
to rest

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:34.030
after a long journey.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:35.550
The Duke will be here soon.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.040
Yes.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.270
We've searched everywhere
the Duke frequents.

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:45.340
Dragging on like this
won't solve anything.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:46.350
The Duke has gone missing.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:47.400
If word of this leaks out,

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.310
all his subordinates

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:51.240
and all the people will be in danger.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.750
At this point,

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:04.420
we have to take the risk.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.560
Qi Chang.

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:14.680
I truly don't know where he's gone.

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:16.630
Lord Wang.

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:20.160
I need a favor from you.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.720
Liu He, Duke of Changyi.

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.790
By imperial edict,

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.790
Lecheng, Grand Herald,
De, Minister of Imperial Clan,

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:52.440
Bingji, Imperial Advisor,

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.310
Li Han, Imperial Guard Commander,

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:56.750
are here to bring you to Chang'an

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:59.830
in a seven-horse carriage.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.030
Liu He, Duke of Changyi,
accept the decree.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.160
I,

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:17.510
Liu He, Duke of Changyi,

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.710
have listened to the will of Heaven

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:21.120
and knelt to accept the decree.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:27.160
Duke,

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.310
you should prepare

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:30.610
to preside over the mourning rites
of the late Emperor.

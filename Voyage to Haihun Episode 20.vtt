00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:24.740
Lord Gong,

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.960
it's a misunderstanding.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.740
I will see you knave executed.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.470
(This cursed time reset.)

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.230
(It's of little use.)

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.870
(If I still can't get the Qilin,)

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.510
(I'll end up rotting here,)

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.590
(with not even a tombstone to my name.)

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.430
Lord Wang.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:23.470
Lord Wang.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.800
Lord Wang.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.150
Tell Lord Huo,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.840
I really

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.150
can't make it today.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.960
Lord Wang.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.300
(Bashang Post Station)

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.430
Search every corner.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.470
Check thoroughly.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.890
Without Wang Heng,

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:43.910
I won't head to Chang'an.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.120
How is it?

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.400
Well...

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.270
Duke,

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.840
Grand Herald Wei Xian has arrived.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.400
Why haven't you set out yet?

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:54.720
Lord Gong,

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.940
Wang Heng is missing again.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.000
I fear he may have run into trouble.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.060
Duke.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.920
We've found him.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.870
Wang.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.310
Duke.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.000
- Heng.
- Duke.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.910
Heng.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.870
Heng.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.400
What happened to you?

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.310
Listen carefully,

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.960
all my plans are written on this.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.150
You must follow it exactly.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.800
Alright.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:45.710
Li Qi.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.030
Summon the physician.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.870
Yes.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.990
I'm fine.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.360
Hear me out.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.800
Not a single task can be left undone.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.470
Above all else,

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.920
go to the Inner Court

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.910
to seek out Xu Guanghan.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.350
What to do

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.310
and what to say

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.680
are written on the cloth.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.040
You must follow it exactly.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.070
What?

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.400
Aside from De Jiu and Qingge,

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.760
no one else must know our plan,

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.080
especially not Gong Sui.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.200
Heng.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.430
What's wrong?

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.800
What on earth happened?

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.830
Lord Gong is a man of great virtue.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.880
Mandate of Heaven says he'll be fine.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.120
But do not tell him this.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.260
We must protect the rest of our brothers.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.320
Never forget this,

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:30.710
when I wake up…

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.400
Wang Heng.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.590
Wang Heng!

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.730
Li Qi!

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.590
Where are you?

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.270
Wang Heng.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.500
(One month later)

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.460
(July 18, 74 BC, 1st Day
of the 6th Month, Yuanping Year 1)

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.630
(Weiyang Palace, July 74 BC)

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.190
(The blazing sun casts a golden glow
over the hall.)

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.870
(Liu He receives the imperial seal
amidst the ceremonial music,)

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.600
(becoming the ninth Emperor
of the Western Han.)

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.730
(As the adopted son of the Late Emperor,)

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.240
(he posthumously honors the Late Emperor
as Emperor Zhao)

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.790
(and bestows the title of Empress Dowager
upon Empress Shangguan.)

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.190
His virtue embraces all the people.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.530
His grace will bless generations to come.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.600
Thus, Duke of Changyi, Liu He, is enthroned.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Hereby,

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.190
it is proclaimed to all under Heaven

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.040
and spread to every household.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:47.950
Kneel.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:52.750
Bow.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.070
Long live the Emperor.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.440
Bow again.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.160
Long live.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.170
- (As the court roared "Long live",)
- Three bows.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.680
(their cries swept the gilded eaves,)

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.780
Long live the Emperor.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.000
(marking his 27-day countdown of the crown.)

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.190
I, this day, inherit the Mandate of Heaven.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.040
My heart is filled with reverence.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.240
Yet the art of governance

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.150
is not something I can achieve alone.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.860
It calls for the aid
of the virtuous and able.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.200
I've prepared the list of names.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.600
These officials stood by me
when I was not yet an Emperor.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.540
They have talent and virtue.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:40.600
Their deeds are distinguished.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.730
And they bear a heart for the people.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.080
Thus,

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.270
I grant them high office.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.360
Let it be proclaimed to all.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.160
(On the New Emperor's first day,)

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.600
(he grants the Changle Guard command
to Anle, a former Changyi minister.)

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.780
(More than 200 close aides
were granted titles.)

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.380
(In the Weiyang Palace,)

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.380
(Huo Guang gazes
at the spirited young ruler.)

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.480
(His jade tablet trembles in hand.)

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.440
(This Great General
who served three reigns)

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:13.640
(now finds himself shut out of)

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.440
- (the new power map.)
- Your Majesty.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.560
I, Huo Guang,

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.950
have a matter to present.

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:19.010
Proceed.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.600
Your Majesty wishes to appoint new talents

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.040
for the Imperial Court.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:26.620
Without constraint by convention,

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.120
this is indeed a virtuous act.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:28.960
However,

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.190
it is vital to ensure
the veteran ministers

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.190
can contribute to their fullest.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.680
Only with old and new working in harmony

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.240
can the realm be governed in peace.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.750
This has been the practice of our dynasty.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.750
Since the founding by Emperor Gaozu,

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.700
after more than a century of changes,

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.520
some policies may no longer
suit the times.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.920
When change is needed, we must change,

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.600
and not cling to outdated ways.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.580
Thus,

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.930
bringing in fresh talent

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.040
is truly a necessary course of action,

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:03.880
all in the hope of

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.900
securing the nation's lasting stability.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.410
Your Majesty acts with firm resolve,

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.720
showing vision.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.880
If so,

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.190
I may also step down

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.950
and take my rest.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.190
Lord Huo, your service is meritorious.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.340
It is indeed time you rested,

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.430
enjoying peace in your later years.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:48.350
Your Majesty.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:56.960
How is Heng?

00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:58.630
Still not woken.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.030
At times, he shakes his head and murmurs.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.480
Did the physician say anything?

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.040
The same words as before.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.320
No external injuries

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.270
nor internal ailments.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:10.010
Though the wound has closed up,

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.300
it still seeps with blood.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.250
Did he say when he might wake?

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.410
Only Wang can wake on his own.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.350
You've no idea
how flustered Huo Guang was

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.360
in court today,

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:28.790
I told him to retire.

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:29.790
And he actually agreed.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.490
You should still be cautious.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:33.850
It might just be a move to retreat

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:34.710
in order to advance.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:35.960
Oh dear,

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.960
you and the Empress Dowager really get along.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:41.440
Then shouldn't you call me Auntie?

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.960
You're taking advantage of me?

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.480
This is the greatest bargain under heaven.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.360
I'm close to the Empress Dowager.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.030
I've already sounded her out.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.200
Huo Guang is her grandfather,

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.080
but the Shangguan Clan fell by his hand.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:58.980
It is moving in our favor.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.510
We only lack Heng now.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:03.000
Don't worry, he's blessed with fortune.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
He will surely wake.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:04.840
Your Majesty,

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.030
Lord Wang has awakened.

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:08.270
Your words are truly prophetic.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.340
(Duke of Changyi's Mansion)

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:16.240
Where did you get those wounds?

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.000
I'll go cut him down for you.

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:20.910
I can't quite say for sure.

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:22.670
How long was I asleep?

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.270
Yesterday was Liu He's Enthronement Ceremony.

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.960
You've been unconscious since Bashang.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.280
That long?

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.080
As expected.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.840
I've been blacking out
for longer each time.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:38.270
I need to step out.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:41.840
Where are you going?

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.680
Hold on.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:43.560
I'll be right back.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.860
(Huo Mansion)

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.960
Quick, go inform Lord Huo.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:58.340
Tell him Wang Heng has come on business.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.030
Are you Lord Wang from Changyi?

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:02.440
- Indeed.
- Lord Wang.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.910
Lord Huo thought highly of you,

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.760
yet you miss every important occasion.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.810
If you disregard his counsel like this,

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:10.930
how can he recommend you to his peers?

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.190
Now...

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.720
He has retired from the court.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.440
Meeting you is less convenient.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:17.170
Lord Wang, you'd best return.

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.110
This is bad.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:28.710
Senior.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:31.110
Where's Heng?

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.660
Running about right after waking up.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.800
Let me ask you.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.240
The matter on the cloth.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.200
How much did you do?

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.000
You're truly extraordinary.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:46.050
We've completed

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.440
all the events recorded on it.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.840
Qingge and the Empress Dowager are friends.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.190
She will surely lend us her support.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:53.070
Mm.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.870
Plus, with the gift from Qingge's father,

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:56.470
the records of official as our safeguard,

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:57.810
at the critical moment,

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.790
the court officials won't act recklessly.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:02.120
I've persuaded Xu Guanghan.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.670
The Wucheng Village is ready to move.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.500
On this cloth,

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.250
only one matter remains unfinished.

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:11.470
Switch people out.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.040
Right.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:14.390
Couldn't get it done.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.560
When I paid homage at the mausoleum,

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.880
he didn't meet with the generals

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.400
and instead came along with us.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.780
I really couldn't find a chance.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.120
Still, aside from matters on the cloth,

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.330
His Majesty granted
the Changle Guard command to Anle

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.800
and had Zhang Sheng in charge of the armory.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.120
All of Changyi's brothers
have official posts.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.360
I even talked Huo Guang into retiring.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.440
Now the court is full of our people.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.060
Oh.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:41.920
Don't worry.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.910
You're an Imperial Censor now.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:45.630
Imperial Censor?

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:46.750
What's wrong with it?

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:48.910
Won't risk offending others?

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.230
Coward.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:51.750
Do you realize

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.170
everything you do aligns
with the Mandate of Heaven?

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.350
If this continues,

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:57.800
you'll be deposed.

00:12:58.390 --> 00:12:59.440
What?

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.030
What is the Mandate of Heaven about?

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:03.360
Can you just tell me all of it?

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.080
The Mandate says,

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.240
Huo Guang will make you Emperor.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.270
When you reach Dingtao,

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.200
you'll send over 50 men back.

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:12.750
The remaining

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:13.840
follow me

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:14.770
to Chang'an.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:16.100
(Jiyang)
Once in Jiyang,

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.120
you'll seek a rooster
and buy a bamboo staff.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.930
Or we defy fate and change destiny.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.120
In Hongnong,

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:24.280
Chen Shan will be killed
for you seizing women.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.150
Wasn't that you?

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:29.470
That's not the point.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.440
Except for Shan not dying,

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.540
everything else came true.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:34.840
And what will happen?

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:36.230
After that,

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.320
you commit 1127 absurd acts in Chang'an.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.330
On the 27th day as the Emperor,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.550
you take your men out to hunt.

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.320
Huo Guang deposes you

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.320
for corruption and imperiling the realm.

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:50.370
The ministers of Changyi are executed,

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.600
none spared.

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.230
Empress Dowager orders you
back to Changyi.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.840
Now,

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:57.320
you can't get out.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:00.370
The warriors of Wucheng Village can't get in.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.090
We're completely out of options.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:12.840
Wait,

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:14.640
you just said,

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.460
on the day I was deposed,

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.880
I'm taking my men out for a hunt.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:20.510
Isn't that perfect?

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:22.360
We could bring in the villagers by then.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.180
That would see our plan through.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.040
No, we can't.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:25.960
Why not?

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.670
It's far too risky.

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.010
If we slip up at any step,

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.200
you'll be utterly ruined.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.750
There will be no turning back then.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.800
Heng,

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:42.350
don't forget,

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:45.030
you are the one my fate hinges upon.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:49.080
We once defied the odds and prevailed.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.910
Why can't we change fate again?

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:54.480
The Qilin is still in the house of Huo.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:57.910
Yet you hesitate,
swallowing your feelings.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:59.480
Victory hangs in this moment.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.120
If you shrink back now,

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.510
how will you face the consequences?

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.150
Better to know nothing and take the leap.

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.990
No way.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:09.590
This matter

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.390
must be planned carefully.

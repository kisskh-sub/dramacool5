[children shouting]

00:24.024 --> 00:25.317
[shouting stops]

00:27.528 --> 00:29.196
[girl] This is a true story.

00:30.364 --> 00:33.158
It happened right here
in my town two years ago.

00:34.451 --> 00:37.037
A lot of people die
in a lot of really weird ways

00:37.120 --> 00:38.413
in this story,

00:38.497 --> 00:39.957
but you're not gonna find it
in the news

00:40.040 --> 00:41.625
or anywhere like that

00:41.708 --> 00:44.837
because the police and
the top people in this town

00:44.920 --> 00:46.213
were, like, so embarrassed

00:46.296 --> 00:47.881
that they weren't able
to solve it

00:47.965 --> 00:49.925
that they covered everything
all up.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.512
But if you come here
and ask anyone,

00:53.595 --> 00:54.847
they'll all tell you
the same thing

00:54.930 --> 00:56.890
that I'm gonna tell you now.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.519
This story starts
in my school.

01:01.979 --> 01:03.355
Maybrook Elementary

01:03.438 --> 01:05.649
is kindergarten
through fifth grade.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.152
So this one Wednesday

01:09.236 --> 01:11.864
is like a normal day
for the whole school.

01:12.698 --> 01:15.617
And they had this teacher
who was new.

01:16.451 --> 01:19.121
Her name was Justine Gandy.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.958
And on this day,
she was going to her classroom

01:23.041 --> 01:24.543
just like every morning.

01:25.752 --> 01:27.713
But today was different.

01:28.672 --> 01:31.258
Today, none of her kids
were there.

01:32.676 --> 01:35.971
Every other class at that
school had all their kids.

01:36.054 --> 01:39.474
Even the other third grade
Mrs. Belt taught was full.

01:40.684 --> 01:43.937
But Mrs. Gandy's room
was totally empty.

01:45.564 --> 01:48.275
Well, not totally.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.153
There was one boy there.

01:51.236 --> 01:54.156
And his name was Alex Lilly.

01:54.907 --> 01:58.035
And he was the only kid
in the class of 18

01:58.118 --> 01:59.953
that came to school that day.

02:01.163 --> 02:02.539
And do you know why?

02:03.582 --> 02:05.375
He was the only one there

02:05.959 --> 02:09.880
because the night before
at 2:17 in the morning,

02:09.963 --> 02:13.091
every other kid woke up,

02:13.175 --> 02:14.510
got out of bed,

02:16.428 --> 02:17.846
walked downstairs,

02:19.306 --> 02:21.099
opened the front door,

02:21.183 --> 02:24.520
walked across the front yard
and into the dark.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.941
And they never came back.

[girl] All the parents
and people at the school

04:12.294 --> 04:14.254
were really sad and upset.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.716
The police could tell
that the kids left at 2:17

04:19.468 --> 04:21.428
because, like, half the houses
had alarms

04:21.512 --> 04:23.764
that got tripped
when they walked outside.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.520
Some of the kids
even got videoed

04:29.603 --> 04:31.104
by the houses
that had cameras.

04:32.648 --> 04:34.483
But the cameras
only showed the kids

04:34.566 --> 04:36.443
walking out into the darkness.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.656
They didn't show
where they went after that.

04:43.492 --> 04:45.494
The police talked
to Alex a lot.

04:47.371 --> 04:50.332
They asked him why his
classmates did what they did,

04:50.415 --> 04:52.209
but he told them
he didn't know.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.212
They asked him
if there was a plan,

04:55.295 --> 04:57.506
but he said if there was,
he never heard it.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.634
They asked him
if there was a TV show

05:00.717 --> 05:02.427
where someone ran away
like that,

05:03.428 --> 05:05.889
but he said if there was,
he never saw it.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.394
They also talked to Mrs. Gandy
a whole bunch,

05:10.477 --> 05:12.104
but she also
didn't know anything

05:12.187 --> 05:13.355
and couldn't help them.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.358
For almost a whole month,

05:16.441 --> 05:19.319
they kept the school closed
for their big investigation.

05:21.029 --> 05:24.032
But after a while, they had to
open everything back up,

05:24.116 --> 05:27.327
so that the kids that didn't
disappear could learn again.

05:29.121 --> 05:30.914
One night before they did,

05:30.998 --> 05:33.166
they had a big meeting
at the school.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.294
There was a bunch
of counselors

05:35.377 --> 05:36.712
and people like that

05:36.795 --> 05:39.256
to help everybody figure out
how to feel

05:39.339 --> 05:41.592
and be sad together, I guess.

05:44.178 --> 05:46.597
This is where the story
really starts.

05:52.311 --> 05:55.439
[man] What's important is
that we don't judge our grief.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.983
We might experience emotions
we don't like.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.027
Emotions besides sadness.

06:00.986 --> 06:03.071
We need to make sure
that we allow ourselves

06:03.155 --> 06:05.157
to feel emotions like anger.

06:06.283 --> 06:10.037
Anger is a very healthy part
of the grief cycle.

06:10.579 --> 06:13.498
It can be especially powerful
in instances of abandonment.

06:13.582 --> 06:15.250
Now, there are often times
that we...

06:15.334 --> 06:16.793
[parent 1]
What does that mean?

06:16.877 --> 06:20.005
"Especially powerful
in instances of abandonment"?

06:20.088 --> 06:22.216
Are you saying that we should
be upset with Matthew?

06:22.299 --> 06:23.592
I'm saying it wouldn't
be abnormal...

06:23.675 --> 06:24.801
[parent 1]
I'll tell you right now

06:24.885 --> 06:26.553
that you may call
what happened "abandonment,"

06:26.637 --> 06:28.472
but I don't.
I don't see it like that.

06:28.555 --> 06:32.059
I see something that doesn't
make any sense at all.

06:32.142 --> 06:36.438
We're talking about 17 kids
in one classroom.

06:36.522 --> 06:38.273
What happened
in that classroom?

06:38.357 --> 06:41.026
Why just her classroom?
Why only hers?

06:41.109 --> 06:42.110
-[parent 2] Yeah!
-[others shout]

06:42.194 --> 06:43.570
[counselor] Look, I'm
picking up a lot of emotion,

06:43.654 --> 06:44.488
and that's fine.

06:44.571 --> 06:45.948
[parent 1] So you'll
forgive me if I'm not

06:46.031 --> 06:48.534
particularly interested in
hearing any more out of you.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.827
I wanna hear
from Justine Gandy.

06:50.911 --> 06:51.954
-[parent 2] Yeah.
-[others shout]

06:52.037 --> 06:54.164

I wanna know exactly

06:54.248 --> 06:56.083
what she was doing in there.

I've...

07:07.302 --> 07:08.303
First...

07:10.097 --> 07:15.102
I just wanna say
how very sorry I am for...

07:15.185 --> 07:16.770
all of what's happened.

07:18.856 --> 07:22.860
I know there's nothing
I can say to make this better.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.865
The truth is,
is that I want an answer

07:27.948 --> 07:30.492
-just as bad as all of you.

exactly what's going on.

07:41.378 --> 07:43.297
I know... I know it's...
it's not...

07:43.380 --> 07:45.632

she tells us what happened!

07:48.093 --> 07:50.804
Okay, now that kind of thing
is really not called for.

07:50.888 --> 07:52.222
I'm serious.

07:52.306 --> 07:53.223
Mrs. Gandy is here

07:53.307 --> 07:55.517
as an affected member
of this community,

07:55.601 --> 07:56.727
and she is hurting
just like all of us.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.478

negligent or complicit!

our children, Mrs. Gandy?

08:03.901 --> 08:05.986
That's enough. Everybody needs
to give us some space.

Please. Please.
It's been a long, long night.

you can stay with tonight?

08:15.704 --> 08:17.122
-Mm-mmm.
-Then I recommend you going

08:17.206 --> 08:18.540

12:58.904 --> 13:01.448
Justine, the scene last night
was just proof

13:01.532 --> 13:04.076
that we have a lot
of emotional parents here.

13:04.701 --> 13:05.786
For now, I think it's best

if you keep some distance
from this place

He's in Mrs. Belt's class,

13:19.466 --> 13:20.884
that the best thing
that we can do for him

13:20.968 --> 13:23.303
is keep him on a routine.

with him.

We've had this
conversation before.

That's out of the question.

I would feel so much better

that I don't care

The issue isn't you caring
or not caring.

13:52.416 --> 13:54.626
The issue here is,
you have a pattern

13:54.710 --> 13:56.628
in which you overstep
professional lines

32:47.509 --> 32:48.552
How things looking?

32:48.635 --> 32:50.596
[chuckles] Little bit
of a chaotic morning.

32:51.180 --> 32:52.431
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

32:53.098 --> 32:54.641
Marc went to go pick up
the sodding,

32:54.725 --> 32:55.767
but they didn't have it in

32:55.851 --> 32:57.477
'cause the order
never got placed.

32:57.561 --> 32:59.855
Shit. Goddamn it. That...

33:00.772 --> 33:02.232
All right,
I'm sorry about that.

33:02.316 --> 33:04.985
Yeah, we got the owner coming
Friday for a walk-through,

33:05.068 --> 33:07.112
and we're still gonna
have the open frame in.

33:07.196 --> 33:08.447
It's on me. It's my bad.

33:09.114 --> 33:10.949
And then I showed up,
and I see that Alvin

33:11.033 --> 33:13.493
painted the door with the
paint that you ordered, and...

33:14.203 --> 33:15.204
Yeah?

33:15.871 --> 33:17.664
They wanted forest green
and that's red.

33:18.665 --> 33:19.875
-What?
-Look.

33:19.958 --> 33:21.919
Goddamn it. Wait a minute.
Did they send the wrong...

33:22.002 --> 33:23.879
I checked the order,
and we ordered it.

33:23.962 --> 33:25.839
They sent what we asked for,
but what we asked for was...

33:25.923 --> 33:27.591
All right. I fucked up.

33:27.674 --> 33:29.676
I'll take it back,
get the right one.

33:36.808 --> 33:38.310
[low chatter]

33:46.693 --> 33:47.694
Mr. Graff.

33:48.570 --> 33:49.571
Yeah.

33:51.365 --> 33:53.450
We follow up on
every one of these calls.

33:53.534 --> 33:55.202
So I can assure you
that as we speak,

33:55.285 --> 33:57.120
we have officers
aggressively pursuing

33:57.204 --> 33:59.122
every lead that comes
through this station.

33:59.623 --> 34:01.500
So, what about the feds?
They got nothing new?

34:01.583 --> 34:04.253
There continues to be a very
healthy information exchange.

34:04.336 --> 34:06.004
So I can tell you
with full confidence

34:06.088 --> 34:09.049
that they are also pursuing
every lead aggressively.

34:10.342 --> 34:11.802
What's happening
with the K-9 units?

34:11.885 --> 34:14.429
I haven't heard about any
K-9 reports in a long time.

34:14.513 --> 34:16.514
That's because
they don't report to you.

34:18.684 --> 34:20.978
Mr. Graff, I can understand
your passion.

34:21.061 --> 34:23.146
And I don't mind having
these conversations with you

34:23.230 --> 34:24.940
because, God forbid,
if it was my child,

34:25.023 --> 34:26.483
I'd be demanding answers too.

34:26.567 --> 34:29.069
But I need you to trust
that what we're doing here...

34:29.152 --> 34:30.529
She's still not talking, huh?

34:33.447 --> 34:34.449
She knows.

34:34.949 --> 34:36.618
I disagree with that.

34:37.369 --> 34:39.996
You're aggressively
following up on every lead,

34:40.080 --> 34:43.375
and yet she's just out there
walking around free as a bird.

34:43.458 --> 34:45.752
Have you done any looking
into her whatsoever?

34:45.835 --> 34:47.254
Extensively. Yes, we have.

34:47.337 --> 34:48.630
So you know about
her past, huh?

34:48.714 --> 34:50.299
'Cause I've done some digging.

34:50.882 --> 34:52.467
And I've found out a lot.

34:53.092 --> 34:56.346
She had a DUI two years ago.
Did you not see that?

34:56.429 --> 34:58.849
She was let go from her
last school that she taught at

34:58.932 --> 35:00.100
for inappropriate behavior.

35:00.184 --> 35:01.602
Did you not see
that one either?

35:01.685 --> 35:03.896
With a member of the faculty.

35:03.979 --> 35:06.148
She's a troubled person,
is she not?

35:08.275 --> 35:10.027
What is it you think
that she knows?

35:11.695 --> 35:13.655
What do you think it is
that she's not telling us?

35:13.739 --> 35:15.407
Because those kids walked out
of those homes.

35:15.490 --> 35:16.700
No one pulled them out.

35:17.826 --> 35:19.286
No one forced them.

35:19.369 --> 35:20.954
I don't see
anything whatsoever

35:21.038 --> 35:22.623
that points to that woman.

35:25.459 --> 35:27.044
What do you see that I don't?

35:27.836 --> 35:30.547
I see something that
I don't understand at all.

35:30.631 --> 35:31.632
[parent 1] Yeah!

35:31.715 --> 35:35.636
We're talking about 17 kids
in one classroom.

35:35.719 --> 35:37.095
And none of them
talked about it?

35:37.179 --> 35:38.055
[parent 2] Exactly.

35:38.138 --> 35:39.556
And we got how many parents
in here,

35:39.640 --> 35:41.225
and none of us saw it coming?

35:41.308 --> 35:42.768
[parents shouting]

35:42.851 --> 35:45.562
I want to know what happened
in that classroom.

35:45.646 --> 35:48.190
Why just her classroom?
Why only hers?

35:48.273 --> 35:50.442
[overlapping voices]

35:50.526 --> 35:51.818
[parent 3]
Where are our children?

35:51.902 --> 35:52.986
[parent 4]
You're just gonna leave?

35:53.070 --> 35:53.904
[Marcus] That's enough.

35:53.987 --> 35:55.197
Everybody needs to give us
some space.

35:55.280 --> 35:56.698
-Please. Please.
-[shouting continuing]

35:57.241 --> 35:59.243
Let's all get
a good night's sleep.

35:59.326 --> 36:00.911
Wake up with clearer heads.
Please.

36:02.579 --> 36:04.373
-[parent 5] She has answers!
-[parents shouting]

36:09.962 --> 36:11.505
Excuse me, miss, I'm saving up
for a bus ticket

36:11.588 --> 36:13.090
to see my brother. Do you have
any change on you at all?

36:13.173 --> 36:14.216
[Justine] Sorry.

36:47.082 --> 36:48.083
[gasps]

37:19.323 --> 37:20.324
Matthew?

37:35.297 --> 37:36.298
Matthew.

37:38.383 --> 37:39.426
[hinge squeaks]

37:41.845 --> 37:43.055
[panting]

37:49.102 --> 37:50.229
Matthew!

37:53.357 --> 37:54.358
Stop!

38:16.380 --> 38:17.381
Wait.

38:30.853 --> 38:32.271
[thunder rumbles]

38:57.629 --> 38:59.756
[footsteps running up stairs]

39:28.076 --> 39:29.077
Matthew?

40:07.449 --> 40:08.450
Matthew?

40:10.661 --> 40:12.079
[gasps]

40:16.917 --> 40:18.252
Matthew, where are you?

40:22.381 --> 40:23.799
Where did you go?

40:28.679 --> 40:29.680
Talk to me.

40:31.431 --> 40:32.599
Talk to me!

40:39.189 --> 40:40.524
[sniffs, groans]

40:41.817 --> 40:42.860
I'm sorry.

40:44.361 --> 40:46.488
I'm sorry that
I wasn't able to sa...

40:47.739 --> 40:48.949
That I wasn't able...

40:53.537 --> 40:55.789
I wanted to say it
so many times.

40:58.417 --> 41:00.169
I really do want to say it
all the time

41:00.252 --> 41:02.588
because I feel it
all the time.

41:08.468 --> 41:09.595
I love you so much.

41:10.721 --> 41:11.722
[shouts]

41:11.805 --> 41:13.473
[grunting, panting]

41:19.813 --> 41:20.981
What the fuck?

41:51.595 --> 41:53.055
Where's our house?

41:54.097 --> 41:55.390
There.

42:01.480 --> 42:05.442
Where's the tower? Tower,
tower, tower, tower, tower.

42:05.526 --> 42:06.860
Ah.

42:21.416 --> 42:22.417
Show me.

42:24.837 --> 42:25.838
Come on.

42:33.595 --> 42:34.805
[bell chiming]

42:42.479 --> 42:43.605
Hi.

42:43.689 --> 42:45.148
-Hello.
-How are you?

42:46.692 --> 42:47.860
I'm Archer Graff.
I'm Matthew's...

42:47.943 --> 42:49.319
Yeah, I know who you are. Hi.

42:49.403 --> 42:52.406
Oh, good. I know we haven't
spoken before directly.

42:53.073 --> 42:54.950
We've seen each other
at a lot of the same...

42:55.033 --> 42:57.578
-How are you, Archer?
-I'm good. I'm real good.

42:58.370 --> 42:59.663
I... You know.

42:59.746 --> 43:01.707
All things considered, just...

43:03.000 --> 43:04.459
soldiering on.

43:05.377 --> 43:06.712
We have to, don't we?

43:07.212 --> 43:08.213
We do.

43:08.297 --> 43:11.300
Listen, I'm sorry to
surprise you at home like this

43:11.383 --> 43:12.801
in the...
in the middle of the day.

43:12.885 --> 43:14.761
But, um, I don't know
if you know,

43:14.845 --> 43:16.972
but we got some footage of
Matthew leaving the house

43:17.055 --> 43:18.891
on our Ring cam thing here,

43:19.725 --> 43:21.894
and I think you folks
had the same...

43:22.436 --> 43:23.979
same situation with Bailey?

43:24.688 --> 43:25.856
Yeah, that's right.

43:25.939 --> 43:28.066
All right. Well, I'm sure
you showed yours to the police

43:28.150 --> 43:30.194
just like I did, but I-I...

43:31.236 --> 43:34.198
I wondered if you would mind
letting me take a look at it.

43:35.032 --> 43:36.158
I don't need a copy
or anything.

43:36.241 --> 43:37.618
I'm not comfortable with that.

43:42.956 --> 43:44.458
Okay. I understand.

44:06.897 --> 44:07.898
Gary?

44:08.899 --> 44:10.275
Archer Graff. How you doing?

44:10.943 --> 44:11.944
Fine.

44:12.653 --> 44:13.946
Matthew's dad.

44:14.947 --> 44:17.032
Yeah. [sighs] Of course.

44:18.116 --> 44:19.117
How's it going?

44:19.201 --> 44:21.954
Um, I have a strange question
I need to ask you.

44:26.667 --> 44:28.210
It's kinda hard to watch this.

44:28.293 --> 44:30.045
Okay, wait. Go back to where
she steps on the sidewalk.

44:30.128 --> 44:31.129
Okay.

44:31.213 --> 44:32.214
Uh...

44:33.006 --> 44:34.925
Okay. Right there.

44:36.426 --> 44:37.469
[Gary] What do you see?

44:39.096 --> 44:41.598
One, two, three, four...

44:41.682 --> 44:45.143
...five, six, seven.

44:59.366 --> 45:00.450
Sorry.

45:20.888 --> 45:22.556
Come on. What am I looking at?

45:57.382 --> 45:58.383
Hey.

45:59.176 --> 46:00.802
-I want to talk to you.
-Well, I...

46:00.886 --> 46:02.763
I don't think we have anything
to say to each other.

46:02.846 --> 46:03.889
I think you have a lot to say.

46:03.972 --> 46:05.974
You and every other person
in this city.

46:06.058 --> 46:08.310
Believe me,
the message is loud and clear.

46:08.393 --> 46:09.853
I'm the problem. Got it.

46:09.937 --> 46:11.063
You know what?
I think that's the first

46:11.146 --> 46:12.689
honest thing
I've heard you say.

46:12.773 --> 46:14.983
-You are the problem.
-You wanna get in my face?

46:15.067 --> 46:16.360
-You wanna threaten me?
-I'm not...

46:16.443 --> 46:17.569
Nobody's threatening you.

46:17.653 --> 46:19.404
You're barking up
the wrong tree. Okay?

46:19.488 --> 46:21.823
This whole victim persona
that you're taking on,

46:21.907 --> 46:23.534
it might have
the police fooled,

46:23.617 --> 46:24.952
it might have
the school fooled...

46:25.035 --> 46:26.453
[speech fades]

46:28.872 --> 46:30.749
-Stop thinking of yourself!
-Marcus?

46:30.832 --> 46:33.043
You and I are gonna
have a conversation right...

46:33.126 --> 46:34.711
-[Marcus grunting]
-[Justine straining]

46:36.797 --> 46:38.257
[Justine gasping]

46:39.424 --> 46:40.425
Hey!

46:40.509 --> 46:42.928
[Marcus babbling incoherently]

46:46.932 --> 46:49.393
-[Marcus snarling]
-[Justine shrieking]

46:56.984 --> 46:58.277
Just stay down.

46:58.360 --> 47:00.320
[panting, growling]

47:01.446 --> 47:02.447
Hey!

47:05.242 --> 47:06.743
[growling]

47:09.997 --> 47:11.832
[snarling]

47:12.332 --> 47:13.333
[shouts, growls]

47:19.715 --> 47:20.883
[shrieking]

47:26.930 --> 47:27.931
[Paul] Hotel's good, though?

47:28.015 --> 47:29.808
-[Donna] It's fine.
-Yeah.

47:29.892 --> 47:32.477
Not the Ritz, but I'm not
expecting them to go nuts.

47:32.561 --> 47:36.231
Yeah. Well, it's only
for six nights. Right?

47:36.315 --> 47:37.566
Three, actually.

47:37.649 --> 47:39.109
Apparently,
I don't have to be here

47:39.193 --> 47:40.360
for the big wrap-up shindig,

47:40.444 --> 47:42.070
so I get to leave on Thursday.

47:43.488 --> 47:45.824
-Isn't that great?
-Yeah. It's good.

47:45.908 --> 47:47.618
'Cause I'm supposed
to ovulate Friday,

47:47.701 --> 47:49.745
so we can hit the target
this month.

47:51.246 --> 47:53.832
Nice. Okay. Yeah. Good.

47:53.916 --> 47:55.542
I thought you'd like that.

47:55.626 --> 47:58.504
Oh, will you tell my dad
when you see him today

47:58.587 --> 47:59.796
that since I'll be back
for the weekend,

47:59.880 --> 48:02.007
we can make their
anniversary lunch thing?

48:02.090 --> 48:03.634
[sighs]
Yeah, I'll let him know.

48:03.717 --> 48:04.885
He'll be happy.

48:04.968 --> 48:06.678
You about to start your shift?

48:06.762 --> 48:07.804
Yep.

48:07.888 --> 48:09.473
You gonna hit
a meeting afterward?

48:10.432 --> 48:12.768
Um, I wasn't planning on it.

48:14.186 --> 48:15.437
Don't you think you should?

48:16.271 --> 48:17.231
[sighs]

48:17.314 --> 48:18.982
Uh, if I have time,
I'll hit one.

48:19.066 --> 48:20.817
Paul, especially when

48:20.901 --> 48:22.402
you're going to be
spending stretches alone,

48:22.486 --> 48:24.905
I think it's important that
you go to regular meetings.

48:24.988 --> 48:27.449
I'm not gonna drink, Donna.
I feel fine.

48:27.533 --> 48:30.661
If I don't feel fine,
then I'll hit a meeting. Okay?

48:31.286 --> 48:32.412
Okay, sweetie.

48:32.955 --> 48:35.082
Okay. I gotta get going now.

48:35.165 --> 48:37.000
Okay. Don't forget to tell
my dad about this weekend.

48:37.084 --> 48:38.001
Yep.

48:38.085 --> 48:39.670
-Love you.
-Love you.

48:41.839 --> 48:43.173
Jesus Christ.

48:47.219 --> 48:48.220
Hey, Ed.

48:49.179 --> 48:50.305
Hey, buddy.

48:50.389 --> 48:51.682
Uh, Donna's back Friday,

48:51.765 --> 48:54.393
so we're good to have lunch
with you guys on Sunday.

48:54.476 --> 48:55.602
Why's she coming back early?

48:55.686 --> 48:57.563
I guess they're
cutting her loose, so...

48:58.146 --> 49:00.858

01:07:24.878 --> 01:07:26.338
And there's, like, fucking
two wackos over there.

01:07:26.421 --> 01:07:28.048
And it's just, like,
fucked-up. [laughs]

01:07:28.131 --> 01:07:30.300
Um, but-- So how's this...
how's this gonna work, though?

01:07:30.384 --> 01:07:31.426
How do I get the money?

01:07:32.761 --> 01:07:35.013
No, I'm not... I'm...
I'm completely serious.

01:07:35.097 --> 01:07:36.932
I mean, I can show you.
Like, I'll show you.

01:07:37.015 --> 01:07:38.600
Um, but I just... I, uh...

01:07:38.684 --> 01:07:40.394
I really don't wanna come in,
'cause, like, someone...

01:07:40.477 --> 01:07:42.062
Could someone come meet me
somewhere with the cash?

01:07:42.145 --> 01:07:43.230
'Cause like... I just...

01:07:43.313 --> 01:07:45.107
I really don't like
police stations, you know?

01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:47.484
They just kind of freak
me out. I'm, uh... I'm phobic.

01:07:53.907 --> 01:07:54.908
[Paul] Hey!

01:07:56.285 --> 01:07:58.328
What did I tell you?
What did I fucking...

01:08:12.718 --> 01:08:13.760
[James whoops]

01:08:13.844 --> 01:08:16.345
"What'd I tell you, huh?
What'd I tell you?

01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:18.515
What'd I tell you?
I'm a big cop, and I..."

01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:21.935
[gasps]

01:08:25.314 --> 01:08:27.149
[crickets chirping]

01:08:50.714 --> 01:08:52.006
[panting]

01:08:59.096 --> 01:09:00.682
You're okay. You're okay.

01:09:00.765 --> 01:09:02.684
That wasn't real. That wasn't
real. That wasn't real.

01:09:02.768 --> 01:09:04.019
-It's okay. You're okay.
-[twig snaps]

01:09:07.356 --> 01:09:08.774
[James panting]

01:09:28.877 --> 01:09:30.921
[James panting]

01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:34.883
[Paul screams]

01:09:35.843 --> 01:09:36.844
[James] Fuck.

01:09:40.013 --> 01:09:41.682
Fucker! You stabbed me!

01:09:41.765 --> 01:09:43.517
No, no, no. I'm sorry.
Sorry. It was an accident.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:44.935
It was an accident. I'm sorry.

01:09:45.018 --> 01:09:46.645
Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

01:09:46.728 --> 01:09:47.729
I know where those kids are.

01:09:47.813 --> 01:09:48.981
That's why I was coming
to the station.

01:09:49.064 --> 01:09:50.941
-You're fucking lying!
-No, no, no, I'm not. I'm not.

01:09:51.024 --> 01:09:53.068
I promise. I promise. I know
where they are. I promise.

01:09:53.151 --> 01:09:54.111
Where?

01:09:54.194 --> 01:09:55.153
[stammering]

01:09:55.237 --> 01:09:57.990
They're at-at-at a house,
not far, in the basement.

01:09:58.073 --> 01:10:00.033
What the fuck are you t...
What house?

01:10:00.659 --> 01:10:01.827
I... I can show you, man.

01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:03.579
It's-it's really, really,
really close.

01:10:17.259 --> 01:10:18.844
Oh, fuck me.

01:10:21.054 --> 01:10:22.055
Do you have AIDS?

01:10:23.515 --> 01:10:24.516
Huh?

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.894
AIDS, asshole.
Do you have AIDS?

01:10:27.436 --> 01:10:28.729
Uh...

01:10:28.812 --> 01:10:30.314
Uh, I don't think so.

01:10:30.814 --> 01:10:32.274
Hepatitis? Shit like that?

01:10:33.066 --> 01:10:35.110
I mean, shit,
not that I know of.

01:10:45.579 --> 01:10:46.622
That one, the dark one.

01:10:46.705 --> 01:10:47.998
Right there
at the end of the block.

01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:03.388
Um, excuse me, sir.

01:11:03.472 --> 01:11:05.349
Um, I don't want to be rude,
but, like,

01:11:05.933 --> 01:11:07.476
how do I know you aren't
gonna try and, like,

01:11:07.559 --> 01:11:09.311
take that reward for yourself?

01:11:12.689 --> 01:11:13.690
Sir?

01:11:15.859 --> 01:11:16.860
Sir?

01:11:17.986 --> 01:11:18.987
Officer?

01:11:20.614 --> 01:11:22.574
Oh, man.

01:11:37.422 --> 01:11:38.966
[no audible dialogue]

01:11:41.385 --> 01:11:42.553
[mouthing words]
What the fuck?

01:11:52.771 --> 01:11:53.939
What the fuck?

01:11:54.606 --> 01:11:55.607
[crickets chirping]

01:11:55.691 --> 01:11:57.734
What the fuck? [groans]

01:11:59.152 --> 01:12:02.406
Let me the fuck out of here.
Goddamn it.

01:12:05.617 --> 01:12:07.661
Oh. Thank you.

01:12:13.166 --> 01:12:14.334
[whispering] What the fuck?

01:12:22.509 --> 01:12:25.304
Jesus Christ. What the fuck?
Hey, yo, you good?

01:12:25.387 --> 01:12:26.471
-[Paul snarling]
-Jesus Christ, bro!

01:12:26.555 --> 01:12:28.307
-Hey! Get off me, bro!
-[Paul growls]

01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:31.393
Get the fuck off me!
Get the fuck off me!

01:12:31.476 --> 01:12:32.728
Hey! Fuck!

01:12:32.811 --> 01:12:35.522
Help me! Help me!
Someone, please help me!

01:12:40.694 --> 01:12:42.905
[Justine] I'm telling you,
Marcus. I've seen it myself.

01:12:42.988 --> 01:12:45.657
There's something
very, very wrong

01:12:45.741 --> 01:12:47.034
going on inside of that house.

01:12:47.117 --> 01:12:48.118
If you don't believe me,

01:12:48.202 --> 01:12:49.369
-go there yourself.
-Justine, stop.

01:12:49.453 --> 01:12:50.829
Here's the bottom line.

01:12:50.913 --> 01:12:52.331
Alex has been
traumatized enough

01:12:52.414 --> 01:12:54.499
by the events
of the last two months,

01:12:54.583 --> 01:12:56.668
-as I'm sure you have.
-Marcus...

01:12:56.752 --> 01:12:58.962
Which is why I'm gonna do
you the courtesy

01:12:59.046 --> 01:13:01.006
of forgetting that this
phone call ever took place.

01:13:01.089 --> 01:13:04.468
If a child's welfare
is questioned, by law...

01:13:04.551 --> 01:13:05.636
-Justine.
-...you have to refer it

01:13:05.719 --> 01:13:07.221
to CPS.

01:13:07.304 --> 01:13:08.305
By law.

01:13:08.388 --> 01:13:09.806
Are you really gonna
take it there?

01:13:10.807 --> 01:13:12.392
Is this the corner
you're gonna put me in?

01:13:12.476 --> 01:13:14.811
Just go make the house call,
Marcus. Just do that.

01:13:14.895 --> 01:13:18.649
I'm not authorized
to just make house calls.

01:13:18.732 --> 01:13:20.776
Well, you're a mandatory
reporter. You have to.

01:13:21.485 --> 01:13:22.653
Okay, here's what I'll do.

01:13:22.736 --> 01:13:25.697
I'll invite his parents to
come in, have a talk with me.

01:13:25.781 --> 01:13:28.242
We'll have a face-to-face
at the school.

01:13:28.325 --> 01:13:29.952
Is that acceptable to you?

01:13:30.035 --> 01:13:32.538
Yes, thank you. I would
really appreciate that.

01:13:32.621 --> 01:13:35.082
Okay, then. You're welcome.
Goodbye.

01:13:37.543 --> 01:13:39.336
-[knocking at door]
-Yeah.

01:13:42.172 --> 01:13:43.715
Your two o'clock is here.

01:13:43.799 --> 01:13:44.925
That's fine.

01:13:48.554 --> 01:13:51.348
Well, send them in, please,
Marge.

01:13:53.976 --> 01:13:55.143
This way, ma'am.

01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:11.285
Principal Miller, I'm Gladys.

01:14:12.369 --> 01:14:14.496
Yes. H-Hi. Hi.

01:14:15.038 --> 01:14:16.039
Come on in.

01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:19.334
-Have a seat, please.
-Oh, thank you.

01:14:25.174 --> 01:14:26.175
Thank you, Marge.

01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:32.806
Thank you for coming in. I...

01:14:33.432 --> 01:14:36.143
I know you guys have had
a lot of attention lately.

01:14:36.226 --> 01:14:38.770
Not all of it
could possibly be wanted.

01:14:38.854 --> 01:14:41.148
I'm happy to come by.
It's fine.

01:14:41.231 --> 01:14:42.941
Okay. Forgive me...

01:14:43.025 --> 01:14:44.860
We have not met.
Is that right?

01:14:45.569 --> 01:14:46.945
No, I don't think so.

01:14:47.029 --> 01:14:48.572
-Okay... Phew.
-[Gladys laughs]

01:14:48.655 --> 01:14:52.242
Because I was relatively
certain I'd remember.

01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:55.287
I know I've met
Alex's father before.

01:14:55.370 --> 01:14:56.914
I'm Alex's aunt,

01:14:56.997 --> 01:14:58.498
and his mom's my baby sister.

01:14:58.582 --> 01:15:01.835
Okay. So you're not
his legal guardian.

01:15:01.919 --> 01:15:04.505
Well, no. That would be
his parents, of course.

01:15:04.588 --> 01:15:06.840
Okay. Well, uh...

01:15:06.924 --> 01:15:07.925
Forgive me, Gladys,

01:15:08.008 --> 01:15:11.887
but unfortunately, I need
to speak with his parents.

01:15:11.970 --> 01:15:13.347
[sighs]

01:15:13.847 --> 01:15:15.849
Well, I hate to say it,

01:15:15.933 --> 01:15:18.810
but his parents have been
feeling unwell as of late,

01:15:18.894 --> 01:15:21.688
and I'm staying with them
to help take care of Alex.

01:15:21.772 --> 01:15:23.565
Oh. S-Sounds serious.

01:15:24.233 --> 01:15:26.401
Oh, no. No, it's not serious.
Nothing terminal.

01:15:26.485 --> 01:15:28.028
It's just a touch
of consumption.

01:15:28.111 --> 01:15:29.655
"A touch of consumption"?

01:15:30.322 --> 01:15:31.156
Yeah.

01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:33.325
You know what?

01:15:33.408 --> 01:15:34.493
I'm embarrassed to say

01:15:34.576 --> 01:15:36.912
I guess I don't really know
what that means.

01:15:37.412 --> 01:15:38.413
I thought it was something

01:15:38.497 --> 01:15:40.249
settlers got
on the Oregon Trail.

01:15:40.332 --> 01:15:41.917
[both laughing]

01:15:42.668 --> 01:15:44.753
-What is it? Tuberculosis?
-You know what?

01:15:44.837 --> 01:15:49.299
They are doing just fine,
but they need to stay home.

01:15:50.926 --> 01:15:53.679
I had hoped to speak to them
in person because...

01:15:53.762 --> 01:15:56.139
[inhales] ...this is awkward,

01:15:56.682 --> 01:15:59.935
but a concerned individual has
lodged a welfare complaint.

01:16:00.018 --> 01:16:01.937
And unfortunately,
I need to make contact

01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:04.231
with the child's
legal guardian.

01:16:04.314 --> 01:16:06.608
It's something
that's not really negotiable.

01:16:06.692 --> 01:16:09.444
I need to speak
with their parents in person.

01:16:09.528 --> 01:16:10.946
Oh, dear.

01:16:11.029 --> 01:16:13.782
I could come over to the house
if that would make it easier.

01:16:14.575 --> 01:16:17.244
I'm just trying to avoid
involving CPS.

01:16:17.327 --> 01:16:18.871
-But frankly...
-CPS?

01:16:18.954 --> 01:16:21.081
...I'm not convinced
that anything is wrong.

01:16:21.164 --> 01:16:22.749
Who made the complaint?

01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:25.544
I'm not at liberty to say.

01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:30.048
Well, this is very upsetting.

01:16:30.132 --> 01:16:33.468
[TV] It is now that
all free will has been lost.

01:16:34.845 --> 01:16:36.722
The ant moves
under the direction

01:16:36.805 --> 01:16:39.099
of a mind separate
from its own.

01:16:41.268 --> 01:16:42.853
Here, the ant initiates
its death grip.

01:16:42.936 --> 01:16:44.688
Yum, yum, yum.

01:16:44.771 --> 01:16:45.814
There we go.

01:16:48.442 --> 01:16:52.738
As the parasitic Cordyceps
continue to feed off its body.

01:16:52.821 --> 01:16:54.281
That's disgusting.

01:16:57.868 --> 01:16:59.870
Fungal fruiting occurs next.

01:17:01.663 --> 01:17:03.207
-Large blooms...
-[doorbell rings]

01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:04.374
...that serve
to spread more spores...

01:17:04.458 --> 01:17:05.459
Who could that be?

01:17:08.086 --> 01:17:11.131
...that will find more ants.

01:17:11.757 --> 01:17:12.758
[man] Ew.

01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:18.388
[panting]

01:17:18.472 --> 01:17:20.307
-Thank God you're home.
-[man] Who is it?

01:17:21.141 --> 01:17:22.851
I'm so sorry to disturb you
on a Saturday.

01:17:22.935 --> 01:17:24.853
Oh, will you please,
please forgive me?

01:17:24.937 --> 01:17:26.230
We're just sitting down.

01:17:26.313 --> 01:17:28.899
The bus didn't pick me up
where it was scheduled to.

01:17:28.982 --> 01:17:30.901
And I had realized
far too late...

01:17:30.984 --> 01:17:32.319
[inhales]

01:17:32.402 --> 01:17:34.404
...that I was standing
on the wrong corner.

01:17:34.488 --> 01:17:35.906
And by the time
I put that together,

01:17:35.989 --> 01:17:38.575
oh, I'd missed it entirely.

01:17:38.659 --> 01:17:42.454
So I had to walk all the way
across town to get here.

01:17:42.538 --> 01:17:43.997
Well, I'm so sorry
to hear that...

01:17:44.081 --> 01:17:46.083
I am sorry to tell you this,
sweetie,

01:17:46.166 --> 01:17:48.669
but I am on the verge
of collapse.

01:17:48.752 --> 01:17:49.586
Oh.

01:17:51.755 --> 01:17:53.590
Could I please
have some water?

01:17:54.925 --> 01:17:55.926
I'm afraid that's re...

01:17:56.009 --> 01:17:58.220
Of course
you can have some water.

01:17:58.303 --> 01:17:59.513
Oh, thank you so much.

01:17:59.596 --> 01:18:00.973
I'm afraid
it's really not a...

01:18:01.056 --> 01:18:02.850
My name's Gladys,
it's so nice to meet you.

01:18:02.933 --> 01:18:03.934
Hi.

01:18:04.643 --> 01:18:08.230
Oh! I absolutely love
this house.

01:18:08.313 --> 01:18:11.149
Look, a giraffe
and a green Chinese la...

01:18:11.233 --> 01:18:13.277
That's original in there.
I bet it is.

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.571
[clapping]
Oh, I just love this kitchen.

01:18:15.654 --> 01:18:19.157
Clean, white cabinets.
How I'm envious of that.

01:18:19.241 --> 01:18:20.284
[laughs]

01:18:20.993 --> 01:18:23.287
Now, listen.
I know that it's inconvenient,

01:18:23.370 --> 01:18:25.080
but I really needed
to speak to you

01:18:25.163 --> 01:18:27.082
about our conversation
yesterday.

01:18:27.165 --> 01:18:28.750
[coughs] Oh.

01:18:28.834 --> 01:18:29.710
[coughs]

01:18:29.793 --> 01:18:31.295
Marcus, get her a glass.

01:18:31.378 --> 01:18:33.046
A bowl, please.

01:18:35.132 --> 01:18:36.133
A bowl?

01:18:36.216 --> 01:18:38.719
Yes, a bowl.
It's a peculiarity of mine.

01:18:38.802 --> 01:18:40.888
I don't even try
to rationalize it anymore.

01:18:43.891 --> 01:18:46.768
A bowl of water. Okay.

01:18:46.852 --> 01:18:47.936
Thank you.

01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:50.480
I-I wanted you to know that
I talked to Alex's father,

01:18:50.564 --> 01:18:52.399
who's very ill, as I said.

01:18:52.482 --> 01:18:54.651
But the good news is,
he's more than happy

01:18:54.735 --> 01:18:57.154
to come in Monday,
sit down with you

01:18:57.237 --> 01:18:58.530
and clear everything up.

01:18:59.573 --> 01:19:02.492
I appreciate that,
but it really is unnecessary.

01:19:02.576 --> 01:19:04.912
So there's no need to contact
the authorities, right?

01:19:04.995 --> 01:19:05.829
That's, uh...

01:19:06.538 --> 01:19:07.831
Sure, I guess not.

01:19:07.915 --> 01:19:10.167
I mean, you haven't
contacted them yet, right?

01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:13.086
Gladys, I'm really gonna
have to insist that you, uh...

01:19:15.422 --> 01:19:17.132
Is... Is that my ribbon?

01:19:19.718 --> 01:19:21.929
You haven't
contacted them, right?

01:19:22.971 --> 01:19:24.806
No, I haven't. What is this?

01:19:27.392 --> 01:19:28.393
[man] Oh, my God!

01:19:28.477 --> 01:19:30.896
Whoops! Look what I did.
Oh, my goodness.

01:19:30.979 --> 01:19:32.523
Why did you do that?

01:19:32.606 --> 01:19:34.733
Well, it was an accident,
of course.

01:19:34.816 --> 01:19:36.944
Wow. That's really bleeding.

01:19:37.027 --> 01:19:38.111
Terry, go get the alcohol

01:19:38.195 --> 01:19:39.655
-and the first aid kit.
-Okay.

01:19:39.738 --> 01:19:42.074
Oh, no, no, no.
That's nonsense.

01:19:42.157 --> 01:19:44.660
Could you get me
a rag, sweetie?

01:19:44.743 --> 01:19:46.203
[stammering]

01:19:52.042 --> 01:19:53.210
[shrieks]

01:19:53.794 --> 01:19:54.878
I think she cut my hair!

01:19:54.962 --> 01:19:56.088
I'm calling 911.

01:19:56.171 --> 01:19:57.965
Marcus, I think
she cut my hair!

01:19:58.048 --> 01:20:00.342
Marcus, what did she do?

01:20:02.219 --> 01:20:03.387
[dings]

01:20:05.973 --> 01:20:07.391
[choking, panting]

01:20:11.812 --> 01:20:12.813
Marcus?

01:20:16.775 --> 01:20:17.776
Marcus?

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:28.954
[gasps]

01:20:36.461 --> 01:20:38.088
[gurgling]

01:20:50.142 --> 01:20:51.393
-Well...

-[Marcus panting]
-[dog barking]

01:22:09.096 --> 01:22:10.138
[person on street] Look!

01:22:10.222 --> 01:22:11.223
[car tires screech,
horn honks]

01:22:12.474 --> 01:22:13.892
[person in park]
Yo, what the fuck, man?

01:22:15.769 --> 01:22:17.020
[people in park shouting]

01:22:17.771 --> 01:22:18.772
[person at table] Oh, my God.

01:22:18.856 --> 01:22:20.607
[panting continuing]

01:22:26.613 --> 01:22:28.407
[Archer] Come out with it.
Just think of the kids.

01:22:28.490 --> 01:22:30.075
-Stop thinking of yourself!
-[Justine] Marcus?

01:22:30.158 --> 01:22:31.994
-You and I are gonna have a...

[Archer yells]

01:22:45.591 --> 01:22:46.967
[snarling]

01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:50.762
[Archer yells]

01:22:52.055 --> 01:22:53.056
[Archer] Stay down.

01:22:55.726 --> 01:22:57.144
Hey! Stop! No!

01:22:58.562 --> 01:23:00.355
Oh, my God. [whimpering]

01:23:00.439 --> 01:23:02.441
Help me, please. Please.

01:23:02.524 --> 01:23:04.234
Oh, God. No! [screams]

01:23:04.318 --> 01:23:05.819
-[whimpering]
-[door chimes]

01:23:09.448 --> 01:23:10.449
[shrieking]

01:23:11.575 --> 01:23:12.576
Oh, my God.

01:23:12.659 --> 01:23:14.703
[screaming]

01:23:18.457 --> 01:23:19.833
[shrieking]

01:23:20.876 --> 01:23:22.002
[Archer] Hey!

01:23:24.838 --> 01:23:25.839
Oh, my...

01:23:25.923 --> 01:23:27.299
[gasping]

01:23:30.010 --> 01:23:31.428
[whimpers, babbles]

01:23:34.973 --> 01:23:37.226
-Get out of my store!
-Fucking help me!

01:23:37.309 --> 01:23:39.061
[shrieking]

01:23:44.107 --> 01:23:45.609

[snarling]

01:23:53.909 --> 01:23:55.202
[Justine screaming]

01:24:01.959 --> 01:24:03.043
What the fuck?

01:24:03.794 --> 01:24:05.170
[groaning]

01:24:09.883 --> 01:24:10.884
Motherfucker.

01:24:21.812 --> 01:24:23.814
Come on, you piece of shit.

01:24:29.111 --> 01:24:31.446
[muffled screaming]

01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:39.162
[screaming continuing]

01:24:41.290 --> 01:24:42.583
[woman screaming]

01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:49.590
[sound becomes clearer]

01:24:49.673 --> 01:24:52.301
[woman continues screaming]

01:24:54.261 --> 01:24:55.846
[low chattering]

01:25:02.728 --> 01:25:04.438
[no audible dialogue]

01:25:27.586 --> 01:25:28.587
Are you okay?

01:25:29.713 --> 01:25:31.673
Yeah, I think so.

01:25:32.466 --> 01:25:33.467
I'm just, uh...

01:25:34.593 --> 01:25:35.594
scraped up.

01:25:36.303 --> 01:25:37.304
You?

01:25:39.348 --> 01:25:40.349
The same.

01:25:41.850 --> 01:25:43.101
I-I wanna thank you.

01:25:43.185 --> 01:25:45.020
-Ah...
-No, I do. So, thank you.

01:25:47.439 --> 01:25:48.440
Sure.

01:25:48.982 --> 01:25:50.442
I mean, what else could I do?

01:25:53.195 --> 01:25:54.530
Guy was out of control.

01:25:55.447 --> 01:25:58.659
The last time I talked to him,
he was fine.

01:25:58.742 --> 01:26:00.202
I mean, he really was.

01:26:00.702 --> 01:26:01.703
[stammers]

01:26:02.329 --> 01:26:05.457
I've never seen anything
like that in my life.

01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:07.501
I have.

01:26:08.335 --> 01:26:09.670
What are you talking about?

01:26:11.046 --> 01:26:13.507
The way he was running,
I've seen that before.

01:26:17.553 --> 01:26:18.804
Can I show you something?

01:26:20.138 --> 01:26:23.016
Their little girl ran
the same way Matthew did.

01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:25.352
Same posture, same exact way.

01:26:25.435 --> 01:26:28.188
Just like Marcus
ran after you today.

01:26:28.272 --> 01:26:29.648
He was weaponized.

01:26:29.731 --> 01:26:32.901
Like a heat-seeking missile
just locked onto you.

01:26:33.694 --> 01:26:36.321
So, here. Look at this.
This is my house.

01:26:36.405 --> 01:26:37.990
This is Bailey Kramer's house.

01:26:38.073 --> 01:26:40.200
Now, if you assume they were
heading in a straight line

01:26:40.284 --> 01:26:42.286
at just some target of theirs,

01:26:42.369 --> 01:26:44.663
and you assume they both had
the same target,

01:26:44.746 --> 01:26:47.332
those lines intersect
somewhere around here.

01:26:47.416 --> 01:26:48.250
Oh, my God.

01:26:48.333 --> 01:26:49.710
There must be something
about this area.

01:26:49.793 --> 01:26:52.004
-Alex.
-Some-- What?

01:26:52.713 --> 01:26:55.090
Alex Lilly lives
in this house.

01:27:01.054 --> 01:27:04.224
Who else can think
of an example of a parasite?

01:27:04.766 --> 01:27:05.767
Anyone?

01:27:06.727 --> 01:27:08.478
-Lisa?
-A tapeworm.

01:27:08.562 --> 01:27:10.772
A tapeworm! Very good!

01:27:10.856 --> 01:27:12.441
That's a gross one, right?

01:27:12.524 --> 01:27:16.069
It lives in your intestines
and it eats your food.

01:27:16.153 --> 01:27:17.487
[children chattering]

01:27:20.657 --> 01:27:21.867
Stop it.

01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:22.951
"Stop it."

01:27:24.369 --> 01:27:26.663
-"Stop it."
-[other children laughing]

01:27:26.747 --> 01:27:27.789
"Stop it."

01:27:29.041 --> 01:27:30.083
"Stop it."

01:27:38.258 --> 01:27:40.177
[children chatter, shout]

01:27:46.558 --> 01:27:47.726
[man] What's up, Axe Man?

01:27:50.687 --> 01:27:53.023
Talk to me, Axe Man.
How was school today?

01:27:53.941 --> 01:27:56.443
-Good.
-Good? Kiss any supermodels?

01:27:56.527 --> 01:27:57.986
[chuckles] No.

01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:59.738
No? All right.

01:28:01.448 --> 01:28:03.492
Well,
tonight's the night, pal.

01:28:04.076 --> 01:28:06.537
Your mom's aunt Gladys
is coming, remember?

01:28:07.496 --> 01:28:10.499
[sighs] Why do we have to
have her live at our house?

01:28:11.124 --> 01:28:13.126
'Cause it's like
we talked about.

01:28:13.710 --> 01:28:17.673
She's sick, and she doesn't
have anywhere else to go.

01:28:19.424 --> 01:28:21.426
But I don't even
know her, though.

01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:24.096
Pfft. I hear you, bud.
I don't know her either.

01:28:24.805 --> 01:28:27.683
To be honest, I'm not sure
your mom knows her that well.

01:28:27.766 --> 01:28:31.144
But she's family.
Family's important.

01:28:32.062 --> 01:28:33.605
We gotta help each other out.

01:28:34.314 --> 01:28:35.899
Hey, found a kid.

01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:39.528
Hey. My men have returned.

01:28:39.611 --> 01:28:40.612
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:28:40.696 --> 01:28:42.781
Whoa. Hey. Good day at school?

01:28:42.865 --> 01:28:44.449
-Yeah.
-Okay, good.

01:28:44.533 --> 01:28:47.119
Uh, I would really like to
get this house cleaned up

01:28:47.202 --> 01:28:48.745
before your aunt Gladys
gets here.

01:28:48.829 --> 01:28:50.497
So do me a favor,
get your room cleaned up

01:28:50.581 --> 01:28:52.124
before you start
your homework.

01:28:52.207 --> 01:28:54.168
She's not coming in my room,
is she?

01:28:54.918 --> 01:28:56.170
I'd really like a clean house.

01:28:56.253 --> 01:28:58.463
That includes your room,
so let's go.

01:28:59.423 --> 01:29:02.676
I know. It's horrible
cleaning up after yourself.

01:29:12.978 --> 01:29:14.938
[car doors shutting]

01:29:30.329 --> 01:29:31.538
[dad] All right?

01:29:38.212 --> 01:29:40.130
[mom] Hi! Come in!

01:29:40.214 --> 01:29:42.174
-[dad] Got the door?
-[mom] I got it.

01:29:42.257 --> 01:29:44.092
[dad] One more step.

01:29:55.771 --> 01:29:58.440
[dad] I'm just saying
she looks really bad.

01:29:58.524 --> 01:29:59.775
I don't know if this
is the place for...

01:29:59.858 --> 01:30:02.152
Yeah, well, it's either here
or out on the street, Stephen.

01:30:02.236 --> 01:30:05.739
Well, you know, this ain't
a hospice place, hon.

01:30:05.822 --> 01:30:06.865
I know that. I know.

01:30:06.949 --> 01:30:08.825
We're not equipped for this
kind of thing. All right?

01:30:08.909 --> 01:30:11.119
We hadn't seen this woman
in 15 years.

01:30:11.203 --> 01:30:12.621
She didn't even show up
to our wedding...

01:30:12.704 --> 01:30:13.997
Look, my mom
would do this for her,

01:30:14.081 --> 01:30:16.375
so I'm gonna do this
for her, okay?

01:30:16.458 --> 01:30:17.709
I could really
use your support.

01:30:17.793 --> 01:30:19.002
If at any point
you feel like...

01:30:19.545 --> 01:30:21.588
Alex, honey,
what are you doing?

01:30:21.672 --> 01:30:22.714
I'm hungry.

01:30:22.798 --> 01:30:24.383
Oh, you're hungry.
Okay. All right.

01:30:24.466 --> 01:30:25.634
Well, go downstairs, eat up

01:30:25.717 --> 01:30:28.345
and then go brush your teeth,
okay? It's almost 7:30.

01:30:28.428 --> 01:30:31.056
And be quiet back there.
Your aunt Gladys is sleeping.

01:30:56.665 --> 01:30:57.666
[door creaks]

01:31:08.552 --> 01:31:10.012

01:31:21.315 --> 01:31:22.149
[gasps]

01:31:24.484 --> 01:31:26.612
How long
is she gonna stay with us?

01:31:29.072 --> 01:31:30.532
Hard to say, pal.

01:31:31.617 --> 01:31:33.785
Doesn't look like
she's getting much better.

01:31:35.078 --> 01:31:37.289
So she's gonna stay
with us forever?

01:31:37.372 --> 01:31:38.624
No.

01:31:38.707 --> 01:31:39.750
I...

01:31:39.833 --> 01:31:41.960
I don't think she'll be here
longer than a month.

01:31:47.883 --> 01:31:49.343
[children chattering]

01:31:55.933 --> 01:31:57.851
-All righty, man.
-All righty.

01:31:57.935 --> 01:31:59.102
I'll pick you up
at 2:00, okay?

01:31:59.186 --> 01:32:00.854
-See ya.
-See ya.

01:32:00.938 --> 01:32:02.606
-I love you.
-Love ya.

01:32:06.568 --> 01:32:08.529
[Justine] That's time.
Pencils down.

01:32:09.863 --> 01:32:11.114
Matthew!

01:32:11.198 --> 01:32:12.449
What?
You said, "Pencils down."

01:32:12.533 --> 01:32:14.159
Matthew, outside now.

01:32:14.243 --> 01:32:15.452
Alex, are you okay?

01:32:15.536 --> 01:32:16.912
I'm fine.

01:32:16.995 --> 01:32:19.206
Matthew, let's go.
Get your bag.

01:32:19.957 --> 01:32:22.209
It was a joke. Oh, my God!

01:32:23.335 --> 01:32:24.962
-[bell ringing]
-[students chattering]

01:32:43.605 --> 01:32:45.732
-You miss your ride, son?
-I'm okay.

01:32:45.816 --> 01:32:46.817
You sure?

01:33:36.033 --> 01:33:40.746
Mom, Dad, where were you?

01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:44.917
Hey, Axe Man. How was school?

01:33:46.251 --> 01:33:47.252
What's wrong?

01:33:48.003 --> 01:33:49.171
Alex?

01:33:49.963 --> 01:33:52.090
Oh, welcome home.

01:33:52.174 --> 01:33:53.050
[chuckles]

01:33:53.133 --> 01:33:54.676
How are you, sweetie?

01:33:57.179 --> 01:33:58.597
Let me take a look at you.

01:33:58.680 --> 01:33:59.681
Oh, you know,
I haven't seen you

01:33:59.765 --> 01:34:01.808
since you were
a little teeny baby.

01:34:01.892 --> 01:34:03.227
What's wrong with my parents?

01:34:03.310 --> 01:34:05.854
Oh, nothing, sweetheart.
They're just fine.

01:34:05.938 --> 01:34:07.189
Mom.

01:34:09.024 --> 01:34:11.985
Hey. How was school?

01:34:12.069 --> 01:34:14.863
You see? I told you,
she's just fine. Don't worry.

01:34:17.115 --> 01:34:18.116
Alex.

01:34:19.201 --> 01:34:20.494
Now, don't be rude.

01:34:21.745 --> 01:34:23.163
Why don't you sit down
at the table?

01:34:23.247 --> 01:34:24.831
'Cause I'm making dinner.
I should have asked you,

01:34:24.915 --> 01:34:25.999
but you weren't here,

01:34:26.083 --> 01:34:27.793
so I thought mac and cheese
would...

01:34:28.585 --> 01:34:29.753
Dad!

01:34:29.837 --> 01:34:32.005
Alex, that's it.

01:34:32.089 --> 01:34:34.258
I want you to go upstairs,
wash your face,

01:34:34.341 --> 01:34:35.926
brush your teeth,
and then it is bedtime.

01:34:36.009 --> 01:34:37.052
No dinner for you.

01:34:40.430 --> 01:34:41.974
I'm not kidding, young man.
Go.

01:35:19.178 --> 01:35:20.679
Come. Sit.

01:35:30.856 --> 01:35:31.857
Alex.

01:35:32.524 --> 01:35:33.567
Sit.

01:35:39.364 --> 01:35:41.033
Don't worry about
your parents.

01:35:41.116 --> 01:35:42.409
They're just resting.

01:35:46.663 --> 01:35:50.000
Now, before you go to school
today, I want you to promise

01:35:50.083 --> 01:35:53.212
that you will not tell
a living soul that I am here

01:35:54.213 --> 01:35:56.548
or that your parents
are resting like they are.

01:36:00.177 --> 01:36:01.428
Do you hear me, Alex?

01:36:08.352 --> 01:36:09.353
Watch.

01:36:12.147 --> 01:36:13.232
Ooh.

01:36:23.534 --> 01:36:24.910
Are you watching?

01:36:36.255 --> 01:36:37.548
Stop!

01:36:38.632 --> 01:36:39.800
Stop, Dad!

01:36:42.261 --> 01:36:43.428
Alex.

01:36:52.604 --> 01:36:53.647
Sit down.

01:37:05.284 --> 01:37:07.494
Now, when I tell you
that you are not to speak

01:37:07.578 --> 01:37:10.455
about me or your parents
to anyone...

01:37:12.082 --> 01:37:15.377
you understand what can happen
if you break your promise.

01:37:18.714 --> 01:37:20.465
I can make your parents
hurt themselves.

01:37:20.549 --> 01:37:22.467
I can make them
hurt each other.

01:37:25.721 --> 01:37:28.515
I can make them eat each other
if I want to.

01:37:32.352 --> 01:37:34.021
Do I want to, Alex?

01:37:36.648 --> 01:37:38.066
Do you believe me?

01:37:42.237 --> 01:37:43.572
Promise you will not
talk about me

01:37:43.655 --> 01:37:45.991
to another human being.
Say it.

01:37:47.451 --> 01:37:48.577
I promise.

01:37:50.329 --> 01:37:51.705
'Cause I'll know, Alex.

01:37:54.917 --> 01:37:56.668
Go to school. Take the bus.

01:38:56.353 --> 01:38:57.729
No talking today.

01:38:59.398 --> 01:39:00.399
Good boy.

01:39:01.859 --> 01:39:03.151
You'll need to
feed your parents.

01:39:03.235 --> 01:39:04.653
There's soup in the cabinet.

01:39:06.822 --> 01:39:08.490
Tomorrow,
you'll get some more.

01:39:29.052 --> 01:39:30.596
[students shouting,
chattering]

01:39:53.827 --> 01:39:54.995
[Gladys, distant] Alex.

01:39:59.625 --> 01:40:00.626
Alex?

01:40:23.649 --> 01:40:24.942
Come here, sweetie.

01:40:26.026 --> 01:40:27.694
[labored breathing]

01:40:31.573 --> 01:40:32.616
Oh.

01:40:36.328 --> 01:40:38.038
I'm very sick, Alex.

01:40:40.374 --> 01:40:42.125
Would you like some water?

01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:44.545
Well, water won't help me.

01:40:45.671 --> 01:40:47.381
I'm too sick for water.

01:40:48.590 --> 01:40:50.759
I have been
for a very long time.

01:40:52.469 --> 01:40:53.929
What will make you better?

01:40:56.723 --> 01:40:58.350
Well, I was hoping
your mom and dad

01:40:58.433 --> 01:40:59.643
would make me feel better,

01:40:59.726 --> 01:41:02.396
but it doesn't seem to be
turning out so good.

01:41:03.105 --> 01:41:05.190
Would you like to go
to a hospital?

01:41:05.983 --> 01:41:08.068
Hospital won't fix me.

01:41:13.657 --> 01:41:15.117
But maybe you could, though.

01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:16.493
You could help.

01:41:17.369 --> 01:41:18.370
How?

01:41:19.246 --> 01:41:20.414
Well, at school,

01:41:21.582 --> 01:41:25.085
bring an object from each
of your classmates home to me.

01:41:26.170 --> 01:41:27.337
That might work.

01:41:28.714 --> 01:41:30.299
How will that make you better?

01:41:34.011 --> 01:41:36.138
It might be just what I need.

01:41:39.308 --> 01:41:41.810
And if you got better,
you'd go back home?

01:41:45.772 --> 01:41:47.274
If I got better...

01:41:49.610 --> 01:41:51.028
I'd go back home.

01:41:54.281 --> 01:41:55.365
[laughs]

01:42:52.005 --> 01:42:53.006
Alex.

01:42:54.967 --> 01:42:56.510
What are you doing in here?

01:42:56.593 --> 01:42:59.137
Um, I didn't
feel like playing,

01:42:59.221 --> 01:43:01.223
and I forgot something.

01:43:02.641 --> 01:43:04.601
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey.

01:43:08.063 --> 01:43:09.064
Are you okay?

01:43:09.690 --> 01:43:11.149
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

01:43:12.109 --> 01:43:14.778
You've been
awful quiet lately.

01:43:15.445 --> 01:43:16.613
Quieter than usual.

01:43:17.281 --> 01:43:18.323
How are you doing?

01:43:18.866 --> 01:43:21.326
I'm okay.
I just forgot something.

01:43:22.244 --> 01:43:23.245
It's okay.

01:43:25.372 --> 01:43:26.832
Alex, you know,

01:43:26.915 --> 01:43:29.543
if... you ever want to talk
to someone,

01:43:30.043 --> 01:43:31.461
you can always talk to me.

01:43:33.046 --> 01:43:34.256
Do you know that?

01:43:34.339 --> 01:43:35.424
Yeah.

01:43:35.507 --> 01:43:37.759
You can talk to me
about anything you want.

01:43:41.263 --> 01:43:42.639
I wanna go back now.

01:43:44.558 --> 01:43:46.518
Okay. Go play.

01:44:22.012 --> 01:44:23.138
[clanking]

01:44:24.681 --> 01:44:26.350
[scraping, muffled speech]

01:44:27.601 --> 01:44:29.228
[noise continuing]

01:44:43.825 --> 01:44:45.077
What are you doing?

01:45:07.891 --> 01:45:09.059
[rings]

01:46:31.892 --> 01:46:33.143
[Justine laughing]

01:46:33.227 --> 01:46:34.228
No...

01:46:44.029 --> 01:46:46.281
[Gladys] Stephen here suffered
a stroke a little while back,

01:46:46.365 --> 01:46:48.158
so he's unable to speak.

01:46:48.242 --> 01:46:50.827
And I'm taking care of
the family for the time being.

01:46:51.328 --> 01:46:53.038
I'm glad you both are here.

01:46:53.121 --> 01:46:55.249
Alex, how are you doing, pal?

01:46:55.332 --> 01:46:56.583
I'm okay.

01:46:56.667 --> 01:46:58.210
Now, we're gonna ask you
some questions

01:46:58.293 --> 01:47:00.128
about what happened
at school, okay?

01:47:02.464 --> 01:47:04.299
Tomorrow,
people will come here.

01:47:05.926 --> 01:47:07.845
And they will search
this house...

01:47:12.516 --> 01:47:14.309
and we have to be ready.

01:47:31.994 --> 01:47:33.662
[doorbell rings]

01:47:33.745 --> 01:47:35.205
Detective, come in!

01:47:35.289 --> 01:47:36.290
Good morning, Ms. Lilly.

01:47:36.373 --> 01:47:37.541
-How are you today?
-Fine.

01:47:37.624 --> 01:47:39.376
-Good to see you again.
-Nice to see you too.

01:47:39.459 --> 01:47:41.086
-Remember Detective Colbert?
-Oh, yes.

01:47:41.170 --> 01:47:43.547
We just wanted to come by the
house for a few minutes today

01:47:43.630 --> 01:47:44.840
and look around, uh,

01:47:44.923 --> 01:47:47.801
see the environment
that Alex has been living in.

01:47:47.885 --> 01:47:51.346
And just get an idea of what
the family dynamic is like.

01:47:51.430 --> 01:47:53.599
-Okay!
-Oh. Thank you.

01:47:53.682 --> 01:47:54.683
And... Oh.

01:47:54.766 --> 01:47:56.602
Hey, Alex.
How are you doing today?

01:47:57.644 --> 01:47:58.896
He's a little quiet today,
right?

01:47:58.979 --> 01:48:00.689
-Mm-hmm. Yes, he is.
-Okay.

01:49:05.128 --> 01:49:06.213
Hello?

01:49:15.013 --> 01:49:17.182
Pack your things, Alex,
we're leaving tomorrow.

01:49:20.352 --> 01:49:21.979
Don't step over the salt.

01:49:54.970 --> 01:49:57.389
The cops are here.
What do you think that means?

01:49:59.766 --> 01:50:00.809
I don't know.

01:50:02.144 --> 01:50:03.562
Do we knock? Do we come back?

01:50:03.645 --> 01:50:05.105
Maybe we knock.

01:50:05.606 --> 01:50:08.317
And say what? What...
What are we gonna explain?

01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:12.196
Yeah, I don't know.

01:50:12.279 --> 01:50:13.322
-Let's just...
-Here we go.

01:50:14.948 --> 01:50:16.158
Hey, what is this?

01:50:29.171 --> 01:50:30.214
Is that the cop?

01:50:31.548 --> 01:50:33.050
That's Paul.

01:50:33.133 --> 01:50:35.093
-You know him?
-Yeah.

01:51:07.042 --> 01:51:08.627
[creaking]

01:51:15.676 --> 01:51:16.677
Hello?

01:51:31.859 --> 01:51:32.860
Paul?

01:51:46.206 --> 01:51:48.709
[voice trembling] Paul,
what are you doing back there?

01:51:48.792 --> 01:51:49.626
[Archer] Wait.

01:51:49.710 --> 01:51:51.420

Stop!

Goddamn it.

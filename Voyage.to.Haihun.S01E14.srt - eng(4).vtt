00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.840
(Bashang Post Station)

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.950
Search every single corner.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.840
Check them all.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.520
Have you found him?

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.850
Lord Gong has had the carriages ready.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.910
He's urging us to set off.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.990
Keep searching.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.790
All of you, keep looking.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:37.990
If we can't find Wang Heng,

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.120
I'm not going to Chang'an.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.070
Well?

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.320
Duke.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.760
Wei Xian and his men have arrived.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.480
Why haven't you set out yet?

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.760
Lord Gong.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.230
Wang Heng is missing again.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.840
Could he have run into trouble again?

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.350
It's almost time to enter Chang'an.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.780
Duke, you mustn't delay any longer.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.100
That's exactly why

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.220
I'm feeling so uneasy.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.870
What if we can't find Wang Heng?

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.240
How about this?

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.280
You set off first.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.920
I'll arrange for the attendants
to search along the road.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.250
I'll also leave a message here
at the lodge.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.630
We've just arrived here after all.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.920
We mustn't neglect proper etiquette.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.800
Then that's the only way.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.800
Come on, let's go.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.310
Let's go.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.500
(6th month of 74 BC, Yuanping Year 1)

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.080
Duke,

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.500
I'm here to change your carriage

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.960
into the imperial one.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.460
(Wei Xian, Grand Herald)

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.870
This is Du Yannian, Grand Coachman.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.870
According to our rites,

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.640
(Du Yannian, Grand Coachman)
he'll steer the carriage.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.360
We will ride together into the capital.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.160
That will not be necessary.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.870
Li Qi.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.180
Get in.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.360
Yes.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.840
After you, Lord Gong.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.320
(The Grand Herald in charge
of ritual affairs)

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.430
(welcomed him on the outskirts.)

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.630
(Groom officer readied)

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.630
(the carriage for the Emperor.)

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.700
(Thus,)

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.150
(Liu He got in the carriage,)

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.900
(and the Grand Coachman
drove in the middle.)

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.840
(Chamberlain Gong Sui got in)

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:37.860
Set out.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.340
(as an attendant.)

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.960
(Bashang, Bashang Lodge, Chang'an)

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.320
(As they arrived
at the Guangming East Gate,)

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.370
(the gate guards came into view,)

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.950
(standing in neat rows,)

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.750
(and looking solemn and grave.)

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.590
The Duke of Changyi
has arrived in Chang'an

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.990
to pay respects before the spirit.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.870
Duke.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.590
We've reached the East Gate.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.030
As per the funeral rites,

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.830
you must cry out three times.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.040
I can't cry.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.190
Tell them my throat hurts.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.050
Wait...

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.910
This...

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.400
Duke, welcome.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.500
By order,

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:38.710
I've come especially

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.270
to welcome you.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.600
Why are you here?

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:42.730
Look up.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.000
Why?

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.320
Stare straight at the sun.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.270
Don't blink.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.630
The Duke of Changyi cherishes
the late Emperor's affection.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.360
His feelings run deep,

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.040
which has moved the world.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.920
You've worked hard today.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.630
That's all for show.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.700
Wang Heng acted rather strangely today.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.970
First, he vanished from the lodge.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.830
Then he reappeared at Huo Guang's side.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.510
Tell me.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:57.430
Why would he do that?

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.240
Does he have other plans in motion?

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.190
We agreed
we'd all enter the city together.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.340
Then he turned away and left us behind.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.880
(Huo Mansion)

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:13.840
Lord Wang has arrived.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.190
Lord Huo has given instructions.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.830
Please follow me to the study to wait.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.960
Much obliged.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.940
(Huo Mansion)

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.110
The Duke of Zhou Assisting King Cheng.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:01.830
Lord Wang.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:03.710
You...

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:05.600
What does this mean?

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.190
Lord Huo.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.560
Before I take my leave,

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.160
I have a word of advice for you.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:14.600
Impudent scoundrel!

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.640
Guards!

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.120
Well, Lord Huo.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.800
Your career is indeed flourishing,

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:25.480
but something's wrong
with your household discipline.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.560
Your wife is not being well managed.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.160
Your sons and nephews
are arrogant and overbearing.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.240
Anyway, the fate awaiting your family

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.130
will be far from good.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.970
You can take my advice

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:37.870
or ignore it.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:40.410
Liu He is just a child.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.950
Why act against him?

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.360
You treacherous knave.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.000
How dare you be so brazen before me?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.840
That's enough.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.620
When your family
is wiped out entirely one day,

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.460
don't say I failed to warn you today.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.560
Heaven sends the Qilin
to guard Heaven and Earth.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.050
The firmament shines bright
and grants its wish.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.710
Endless cycles
exist as long as the sun and moon.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.050
All mysteries and connections

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.500
are at my command.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:06.820
At my command...

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.720
At my command.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.390
With all mysteries and connections,

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:17.390
I'll have everything.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.240
Foolish beyond measure.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.310
At my command.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.000
With all mysteries and connections,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.830
I'll lose everything...

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:37.750
Lord Huo, please don't be angry.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:38.910
I...

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.140
Hand it over.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:58.780
(26th day)

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.820
(25th day of the 6th month, 74 BC)

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.070
Make sure to rest early tonight.

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:05.660
Do we have any special game here?

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:08.150
Duke.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.160
We're close to Chang'an.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.070
You must watch your words and actions.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.440
Alright, alright.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.820
What's wrong with you?

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.300
I've found the one
who killed your master.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:19.590
Who is it?

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.040
Wait here for me.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:22.890
Go in.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.800
What happened?

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.110
You gave me a fake spell.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.200
How do you know it's fake?

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.030
The way you asked proves it's fake.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.440
What's the real spell?

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:39.990
If I tell you,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.080
what if you run off again?

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:41.920
Say it.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.590
As long as I can get the Qilin back,

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.550
and I can make my wish,

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:46.840
I'll tell you the real spell.

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.000
I just want you

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.960
to stay by my side and help me.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.170
Do you really have to make me
say such cheesy things?

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.360
Then let's talk about the Qilin.

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.320
The Qilin is now in Huo Guang's hands.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.550
The one who killed your master

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.060
is most likely him as well.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.030
So,

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.080
our goals are perfectly aligned now:

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.320
Bring down Huo Guang,

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:29.810
and reclaim the Qilin.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.080
How do you know the Qilin
is in Huo Guang's hands?

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.240
Trust me.
I'm never wrong about these things.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.240
Let's sneak into the Huo Mansion

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.630
and quietly take the Qilin back.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.000
It's not like
we haven't done this before.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.450
The servants are easy to deal with.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.620
But Huo Guang's place
is crawling with soldiers,

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:47.010
guarded by the Huben Army.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:48.750
There's no blind spot at all.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:53.390
What's a blind spot?

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.870
It's the chance to slip in unnoticed.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.580
All the troops are
under Huo Guang's command.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.010
We stand no chance against him.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.270
In seizing power,

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:08.420
the army has never mattered.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.880
To bring down Huo Guang,
it takes three steps.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:14.880
First,

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.720
seize the armory.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.110
Second,

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.600
cut off all official communications.

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:21.770
Third,

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:23.650
take control of the government center.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.270
What do you mean?

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.130
Simply put,

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.930
we shall send troops
to seize the armory.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.540
(Armory)

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.270
Wait for the right moment.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:40.720
When Huo Guang is alone,

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.870
restrain him,

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:44.630
so he won't be able
to alert his allies or the army.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.460
Then, accuse him of treason

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.970
in the Empress Dowager's name.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:56.780
That's Lord Huo.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:57.460
Empress Dowager.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.630
He intends to commit regicide.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:11:59.480
Regicide?

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.510
Drag him out and behead him.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:04.320
The defense of Chang'an

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.900
has always been in the Huo Clan's hands.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.830
If Huo Yu learns Huo Guang
has been executed...

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:08.750
Hyah! Hyah!

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:10.240
He'll rally the Huo Clan to rebel.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.160
Hyah!

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.390
Right now,

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:13.360
we must reclaim the token

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:14.850
and alert the North and South Armies

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:16.250
so they can protect the Crown Prince

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.470
and suppress the uprising.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:24.480
Yu.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.910
The Huo Clan has fallen.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:38.970
Any who still plot treason
will meet the same fate.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.390
If Huo Guang loses his power...

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:41.360
His Majesty is wise.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.560
His allies will be gone, too.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.750
We won't need to control

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:50.820
the government center,

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.320
for you are the Crown Prince.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.810
Once you ascend the throne,

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:56.080
everything

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.510
will be set in stone.

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:20.850
Do you think the Empress Dowager
will stand with us?

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.750
The Empress Dowager's entire family

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:24.890
was slain by Huo Guang.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:26.820
She grew up without parents,

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:28.000
confined within the palace.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.750
It's only natural
she harbors resentment.

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:32.250
Having no parents

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:33.930
is something I understand best.

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:35.510
How about...

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:36.350
- No.
- Don't.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:41.510
I have a plan.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:42.680
Let me handle this.

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.870
Alright.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.970
There's one more thing.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.200
We need a brave warrior

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.470
who can help us seize the armory

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.540
and control Huo Guang.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.390
We have so many men from Changyi.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.560
- How...
- Don't.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:58.440
We need a brave one.

00:13:58.630 --> 00:13:59.930
It's not a game here.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:14.000
Me alone?

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.440
No, that's far too dangerous.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.710
We'll have to enter the city first

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:19.730
and then take it one step at a time.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.440
Hey, Heng.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.840
You seem quite versed
in power struggles.

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:31.240
I heard it from an Up master.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:32.440
Up master?

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:35.000
Up means "up".

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:37.480
The master of an Immortal
is an Up master.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:40.720
Please bless us.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:45.840
I shall take my leave.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.200
Senior, where are you going?

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.280
Wait for my word.

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:52.030
May the Up master keep you safe.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.080
Qingge.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:57.960
Look at Heng...

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.440
I'll take my leave for now.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.120
I'll find a way to get close
to Huo Guang.

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:03.150
First, I'll learn more about his habits.

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:05.490
Then we can act when the chance comes.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.050
You're going to use this
to approach Huo Guang?

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.160
Yes.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.480
May the Up master keep you safe.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.750
Hey, where are you going?

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:25.590
I'm going to give it a try.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.510
Maybe I can find the warrior you need.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.200
Hyah!

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:32.630
Be careful out there.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:45.120
Well.

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.290
Go and bring Wang Heng here.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:48.360
Yes.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:05.840
Such refined taste for someone so young.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.870
There's unease in my heart.

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:09.320
I can hardly sleep in peace.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:11.800
So, I came here to fish

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:14.870
and calm my heart.

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:31.970
Where does the anxiety come from?

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:33.910
With the utmost sincerity.

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:37.270
It's a good thing.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:39.160
Why the unease?

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.670
The closer we get to Chang'an,

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:42.920
the more I feel I fall short of him.

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:45.070
Who is he?

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:46.370
A young man.

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:49.910
Years ago, his elder brother
brought him to Chang'an.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.320
Since then, he has stayed
by Emperor Wu's side.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.020
Diligent and devoted.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.330
Cautious in every step.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.410
Afraid to make
even the slightest mistake.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.680
Emperor Wu was a ruler for the ages.

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:02.910
His standards were exacting
beyond measure.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:06.480
Yet this young man never once erred.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.880
I imagine each night before sleep,

00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:12.110
he must feel both relieved and uneasy.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:13.920
He was relieved

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.580
that he made it through another day
of treading around the Emperor.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.470
Yet what gnawed at him was

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:23.080
not knowing
if tomorrow he'd make a mistake

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.160
that could turn into a grave offense,

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.230
bringing shame to his brother
and the whole family.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:33.720
Life was unbearably hard for him.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.880
But those very hardships

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:39.270
shaped the man he would one day become.

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:41.840
It was his tireless diligence

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:42.890
and his cautious restraint

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.130
that led him to a high rank,

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:45.420
with power that swayed the realm.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.270
Everyone claimed he was ambitious,

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:48.640
but I knew he wasn't.

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.790
From the moment he set foot in Chang'an,

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.000
all he ever wanted was to survive.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.420
Now, I too have come to Chang'an.

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:00.920
This was where his fate began,

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.680
and where mine begins as well.

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:10.960
I am Wang Heng.

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:13.480
I have been waiting here
for you for quite some time.

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:19.670
Young man.

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.670

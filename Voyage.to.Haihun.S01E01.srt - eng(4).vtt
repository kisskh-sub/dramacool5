00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.090
(In 74 BC,)

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.390
(the fourth month of Yuanping Year 1,)

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.390
(Liu He ascended to the throne.)

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.150
(But he lacked experience)

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.610
(in palace politics)

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.110
(and refused to be Huo Guang's puppet,)

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.430
(so he secretly plotted
against Huo Guang.)

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.240
(But the plot was exposed.)

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.520
(Huo Guang claimed his immoral conduct)

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.360
(endangered the state)

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.280
(and issued an edict to depose him)

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.470
(in the name
of Empress Dowager Shangguan.)

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.600
(Even when all seemed settled,)

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.840
(one man still tried to defy fate.)

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:58.630
Go!

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:59.650
Depose me?

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.760
Then you can kill me, right?

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.950
Come on.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.880
Liu He.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.400
I'll save you once more.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.060
(He knows Liu He's destined paths.)

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.280
(Only by this method)

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.480
(can everything)

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.350
(return to its beginning.)

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.420

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.940
(Nanchang, Jiangxi)

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.620
(Wang Heng)
(I'm Wang Heng.)

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.840
(A travel blogger)

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.510
(and)

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.600
(an extreme sports blogger.)

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.580
(Those videos are thrilling, right?)

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.680
(Emergency)
Take a look at this.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.520
How many fingers?

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.850
(My follower count grows slower
than my hospital bill.)

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.990
Hey!

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.840
Where are you going?

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.680
(National Archaeological Site Park)

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.740
- (This is where my girlfriend,)
- This is Liu He,

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.130
- (San, works.)
- Haihun Marquis.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.260
(Liu He)
Liu Che's grandson.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.630
The ninth Emperor,

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.640
also the shortest-reigning Emperor
of the Western Han Dynasty.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.950
According to historical records,

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.080
he ruled for just 27 days...

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.530
And committed 1,127 absurd acts.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.630
Then Huo Guang deposed him,

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.470
right?

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.380
What are you doing here?

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.400
I've found a place.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.630
I'm moving in tonight.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.470
Give me the key.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.440
(Right.)

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.290
(I came here to get dumped
by my girlfriend.)

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.030
(Wait, no.)

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.350
(I should call her my ex now.)

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.910
(My ex.)

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.790
(Huh.)

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.000
(We even skipped a farewell meal.)

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:04.750
Let's go.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.750
(Dating feels more exhausting
than cliff diving.)

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.750
(I wasn't around for her 39Â° fever.)

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.280
(When I was hospitalized,)

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.920
(this girl covered the medical costs.)

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.790
(What did I promise her?)

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.960
(We'd marry if my video
hit a million views.)

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.290
(Now, I can't even outrun
a hospital bill.)

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.940
(Maybe I'm meant to be single for life,)

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.820
(so I won't hurt anyone or myself.)

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.500
(Honorary Confidential)

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.190
(But I found this while moving out.)

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.340
(It had been hidden for 20 years.)

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.400
(When I was a kid,
an uncle cosplaying Liu He)

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.480
(shoved it into me.)

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.710
(Who would have thought)

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.080
(that my muddled, aimless days)

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.650
(would be wound up like a clock by it?)

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.070
(Could it really have triggered)

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.750
(the Mandate of Heaven?)

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.080
Heaven sends the Qilin

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.400
to guard Heaven and Earth.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.120
The firmament shines bright

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.750
and grants its wish.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.680
Endless cycles

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.380
exist as long as the sun and moon.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.640
All mysteries and connections

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.220
are at my command.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.600
(This is the summoned Immortal?)

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.850
I saw it.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.470
(74 BC)
The altar was by the riverside.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.680
(Yuanping Year 3)
Hurry, it must be the Duke.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.540
(Duke of Changyi, Liu He)

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.490
Immortal.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.070
Are you alright?

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:45.660
Who are you?

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.210
Dressed like this so late,

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.500
you could scare people.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.830
I think I'm dressed just fine.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.230
Where is this place?

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.600
Changyi.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.390
Changyi?

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.920
Immortal, let's be serious.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:01.760
Wait.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.490
(Could it be I've time-traveled?)

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.560
Just now...

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.000
Just now, I...

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.170
(Did this thing take me here?)

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.130
Immortal.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.340
(Seriously? It didn't work?)

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.680
I went through so much trouble
to bring you here.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.370
Can I make my wish now?

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:18.670
Ah?

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.180
Answer a few questions for me.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:23.830
I'll tell you

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:24.800
all I know.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:25.710
What era is it now?

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:26.470
The Han.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.560
Eastern Han or Western Han?

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.380
What does that mean?

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.450
It must be the Western Han.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.760
Western Han...

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.350
Run! We'll talk somewhere else.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:44.600
What year is this?

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:45.260
Yuanping Year 1.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.490
Yuanping Year 1 of Western Han.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.280
Duke of Changyi.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.520
Has Liu He become the Emperor?

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:49.440
The Emperor?

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:50.390
Watch your tongue.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.650
So, he hasn't gone to Chang'an.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.390
They're here for you.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:54.230
I'm leaving first.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.910
Stop right there.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.870
Whoa, it's real.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:59.720
Immortal, run first!

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.590
See you!

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.600
Alright, bye.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:03.310
Senior.

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.380
(De Jiu)

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.000
Chase!

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.960
Senior.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.090
Master Yun.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.930
What does this mean?

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:11.950
Hand over the Qilin.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.840
Those who dare to lay a hand on me

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.170
are no mere bandits.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.240
You're sent by the court, aren't you?

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:19.500
The Duke is there.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.720
- Duke.
- Over there.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.650
- Let's go.
- Duke.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.800
Duke.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.160
- Duke.
- Duke.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.760
Duke.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.040
Li Qi, come with me.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.630
Duke, you're being reckless again.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:29.480
We'll talk later.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.320
Go.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.160
Keep up. Hurry.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.320
(Come on.)

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.240
(How on earth do I use this thing?)

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.560
Useless.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:19.360
No way.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.490
I really traveled through time.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.270
Wait, don't kill him.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.040
(Why does she look so much like San?)

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.430
(Could it be she traveled here too?)

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:45.790
San.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.000
Immortal.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:47.900
Let's go.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.760
Immortal.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:50.390
Immortal, where are you?

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.120
(Breaking up and then time traveling?)

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.440
(Is this necessary?)

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.960
(It hurts. I want to go home.)

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.430
Immortal, Immortal!

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.940
(Changyi)

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:04.740
It's been the whole night.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:05.830
He's still in a coma.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.000
The Qilin is merged.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:09.160
The spell's been recited.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:11.040
This is the Immortal we summoned?

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.460
What kind of Immortal is this?

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.350
Such strange garb.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.980
A head of unusual hair.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:17.880
No family or roots to speak of.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.760
He hardly looks like an Immortal.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:21.130
More like a prisoner.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:22.350
Qilin?

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.480
Summon?

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.000
Spell?

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.630
(So, only the spell
will make that thing work.)

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.940
(Only then can I go back.)

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.560
(No phone, no internet.)

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.380
(Feels like the world has abandoned me.)

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:33.480
He's awake.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.880
Immortal, you are awake.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:37.820
I want to make a wish.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.840
(And I have to readjust
to these ancient fools.)

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.110
(So exhausting.)

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.490
You can't make any wishes.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:46.960
No magic instrument.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.680
- Qilin.
- Right.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:49.680
Isn't it with you?

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.080
It's gone.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.220
Where did you lose it? We'll go find it.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:54.120
You've seen her.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:55.780
The girl in red

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.090
who chased after us

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.440
and almost killed me

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:01.840
took it.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:03.630
What did you say?

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:04.510
De Jiu.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:05.840
Senior?

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:07.320
(San came here so early?)

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:08.810
(And even became this guy's Senior?)

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.140
(No wonder she ignored me)

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.340
(and shot me for revenge.)

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.240
Senior must've taken
the Qilin back to Chang'an.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.480
Chang'an?

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.870
(From Shandong to Xi'an
is 900 km by highway.)

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.030
(In ancient times...)

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:18.930
(Oh, no.)

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:19.880
(I can't go back now.)

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:20.910
(I have to count on him.)

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:21.970
Immortal, please help me.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.000
That's okay.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.720
But I have one condition.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.320
(He doesn't seem like an Immortal.)

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:28.750
(More like a charlatan.)

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.270
This Immortal is useless.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.840
Why not make another one

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.440
with Qilin?

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.280
I think so.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:36.750
Sir.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.840
Take me with you to Chang'an.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.160
When the time comes,

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.840
I can help you

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:44.320
fulfill

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.870
even 10 wishes.

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:47.260
Really?

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.110
Sure.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:54.310
I am Qi Chang.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:55.350
Thanks, Immortal.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:57.000
Let us go to Chang'an together.

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:00.840
I am Wang Heng.

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:02.840
A pleasure working with you.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.360
(Look at Qi Chang.)

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:05.730
(He must be wealthy or noble.)

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:06.920
(I have to cling to his favor)

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.150
(and coax the spell from him.)

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:09.580
(This plan sounds solid.)

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.010
(Reaching Chang'an depends on him.)

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:12.480
You must never set foot in Chang'an.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.240
Duke, how could you think
of something so perilous?

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.490
(Gong Sui, Chamberlain-in-Chief)

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:18.030
If a vassal leaves his fief,

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.670
it's a capital offense.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:20.510
Indeed.

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:22.260
Things that happened today

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:23.630
have shown our incapability.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.440
That was nearly a grave mistake.

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:27.510
If you leave...

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:28.350
So wordy.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:29.350
I get it.

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:31.260
The man in black remains unidentified.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.790
We can't tell if he has accomplices.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.720
You must not leave the city.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.150
- And we need more guards.
- Okay.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:40.140
No one leaves without proper papers.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.000
Right.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.790
We'll do exactly as Lord An says.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.360
- Duke.
- Duke.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.270
Where is the Duke?

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:00.720
The city is under lockdown now.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.080
The gates are shut.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:03.680
Ordinary folks can't get out.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.240
Heng, sorry about this.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.390
Then, my dutiful followers,

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:12.550
let's choose an auspicious day

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:14.010
and set out on our journey.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:14.990
We can't depart.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.030
Why?

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.670
We're missing one thing.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.670
The travel permit to leave the city

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.670
is issued by Chamberlain Gong
with a stamp.

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:26.910
Once the letter is written and stamped,

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:28.440
we can leave the city.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.100
Heng, you're an Immortal.

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:31.110
Can't you fly?

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.270
That's called parkour.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:33.110
Not important.

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:34.540
I'll lure Lord Gong

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:35.840
out of his study.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.460
You seize the chance to do that...

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:39.800
- Parkour.
- Right.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:42.870
You must remember

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:44.920
what I say next.

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:47.330
The third room

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:48.600
on the east side

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.570
is Lord Gong's study.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.320
The outer patrols

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:54.550
include two squads of soldiers.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:56.620
They'll follow closely.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.150
Find your time to slip by.

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:00.820
The hardest place to enter

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:02.080
is the inner courtyard.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:04.480
Four guards stand at the gate.

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:06.550
Your only chance

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.870
is when they switch shifts.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.030
Alright, when the time comes,

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:12.090
I'll give you a signal.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:16.710
Heng.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.270
Don't worry; it'll be fine.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.670
When you climbed the wall,

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.550
you finally looked like an Immortal.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:27.240
Lord Gong, Lord Gong.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.440
Coming.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.800
I lost my parents at a young age.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:40.310
What you say

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:41.890
is like a father's words to me.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.750
Why so sentimental?

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.190
Too many foolish things
have been done lately.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.900
It's left me feeling uneasy inside.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.800
Who's there?

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.600
There's an assassin!

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:11.590
Protect the Duke!

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.000
Protect Lord Gong!

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.280
Protect Lord Gong!

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:35.140
(20th day of the 5th month, 74 BC)

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:41.110
Heng!

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.200
Heng!

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:48.920
Heng!

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:51.920
Heng!

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.560
Heng!

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:55.240
(What's going on?)

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.190
(Ow, that hurts!)

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:09.840
Heng!

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:13.630
(That jab felt way too real just now.)

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.320
Did I just go in there?

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:18.870
You just climbed the wall.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:20.510
Why does it feel like you've aged?

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:22.400
(Did I die and come back?)

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:23.550
(I get it now.)

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:24.820
(Oh, my.)

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.410
(My injuries healed, and I was reborn.)

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:27.820
(That's like playing with cheats.)

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.960
âªWatch the storm;
hear the night rain fallâª

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.560
âªTill the light of dawnâª

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.260
âªA truth that cannot be spokenâª

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:53.630
âªRight and wrong matterâª

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.760
âªYet I can't make the right choiceâª

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.390
âªThe lost player in the gameâª

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.760
âªMade a move by a twist of fateâª

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.260
âªThe way back is lost,
leaving nowhere to returnâª

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.490
âªBorrow the endless cyclesâª

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:10.540
âªTo fight for the most perfect outcomeâª

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:13.670
âªHow to trace the threads
and follow cause and effectâª

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:17.440
âªSeeking a strategy without flawâª

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:22.350
âªHow to break free
from this fated yet unforeseen lockâª

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:27.560
âªTo live so as to shake the worldâª

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:32.020
âªWith this journey,
I gain a fiercer edgeâª

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.230
âªI've planned
before I act countless timesâª

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:40.660
âªFatal danger turned into a jestâª

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.990
âªThrough this road,
I watch the endless rise and fallâª

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.110
âªIn the chapters lie ages
of decay and bloomâª

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.040
âªLet us meet againâª

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:54.240
âªOne hurried path, and one at easeâª

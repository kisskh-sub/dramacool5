00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.080
(Adapted:I'm the Most Beautiful Count in Siam,
standing at Tha Phra chewing on a pen.)

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.760
Worradej, what are you doing?

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.880
I’ll use science to create miracles.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.200
At the Fire Crossing Ritual,
when I step into the flames,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.280
you begin the operation right away.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.039
Who are you?

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.520
Which side are you on?

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.640
The mission is complete.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.920
I’ll be back on stage for my concert soon.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.360
Worradej, take me home now.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.360
I need to get back for my concert.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.680
No way.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.120
You’re having nightmares
so bad you’re sleep-talking, Worradej?

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.640
A nightmare, yeah.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.840
But I’m not sleep-talking.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.479
And my name’s not Worradej.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.000
I’m going home.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.360
Where are you going?

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.480
I’m going home too.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:16.880
But…

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.000
I don’t even know how to get back

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.760
or where to go.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.880
Life’s already hard enough
being a trans woman.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.960
And now I gotta deal
with all this too.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.600
You don’t have a home
to return to now.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.240
Lord Singhanakhon’s ship

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.000
was dismantled to use the wood
for building the pier.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.720
All the treasures were sold off
and given to the villagers.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.320
In fact, you as the Count’s child

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.640
were sentenced to forced labor.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.040
But it was me who brought you here.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.040
Kosol.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.000
Tell me honestly.

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.000
Your mission with Banjong,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.560
what else are you planning?

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.360
Can you tell me, please?

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.600
Tell me, please. Tell me.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.840
Didn’t you hear
what King Chaiyached said?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.520
That our next mission
is to storm the capital

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.440
and take down Somdet Saenyakorn,
who’s seized power.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.160
And if we succeed,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.440
we’ll be able to change the law.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.760
And you

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.600
must stay and help me.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.840
I…

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.160
help you

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.760
change the law?

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.920
I’m an idol, you know.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.880
I’m not some kind of revolutionary.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.760
You’re talking nonsense again.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.560
Come here.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.920
Last night, you really hit the spot for me.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.920
Let’s go another round.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.000
Wait, wait, hold on, Kosol.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.520
Talk about this revolution first.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.560
What else are you planning?
Tell me right now.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.840
We’ll talk later.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.400
Don’t… talk… talk…

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.040
Talk. Talk.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.520
Talk first.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.760
(Royal Palace of Thanapura)

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.400
Now,

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.480
Lord Singhanakhon has been stripped
of his rank and position as governor.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.560
The city of Singhanakhon is under
Lord Kosol and the Revolutionary Council.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.760
King Chaiyached

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.240
is also under our custody.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.160
Let Somdet Saenyakorn,

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.640
Lord Kalahom,

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.760
step down from power that
was never his in the first place.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.160
So there’ll be no bloodshed.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.880
Ready the troops.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.240
We’ll go to war soon.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.840
Yes, My Lord.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.840
Law.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.600
Law is the set of rules
established by the state

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.200
or those in power,

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.000
used as a tool

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.680
to enforce actions

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.080
that fulfill society’s goals.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.880
Alright then, hello.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.320
Naiyapinyapat,

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.880
you do realize,

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.680
if the police were here,
you’d already be arrested.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.600
What, just for dozing off in class?

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.640
That’s enough to get arrested, Teacher?

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.440
Isn’t that a bit cruel?

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.200
It’s not about sleeping.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.600
It’s about how you act
against your birth gender.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.960
You’re a man.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.000
You can’t be exclaiming
ka, kha like that.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.760
Yes, Teacher.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.840
Then I’ll be careful from now on.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.760
Naiyapinyapat.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.720
What now, Teacher?

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.200
That hairclip, take it off too.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.720
This law,

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.600
this very law was enacted
in the Thanapura Kingdom

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.640
by Somdet Saenyakorn

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.200
and has been enforced ever since.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.920
Nong Phin, we heard that today

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.240
you have something important
to announce to your fans?

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.240
Yes, it’s…

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.640
something that’s been weighing
on me for a long time,

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.120
ever since I entered
the idol industry.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.360
And today I feel like

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.480
I don’t need to hide this any longer.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.920
I’m going to announce
to everyone that…

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.200
I…

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.120
am a trans woman.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.040
And from now on,

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.840
let’s make it clear, I’m Prince.

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:43.600
Say it together, Prince.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.240
Prince.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.320
I’ll stop lying to myself
and to everyone.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.560
I’ll shine and show the world

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.800
the most fabulous version of me.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.400
Nong Phin, don’t. Please don’t.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.600
You’ll get in trouble.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.280
Then let me face it.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.960
If our country still has
laws like these,

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.400
even if it’s a court order
or an arrest warrant,

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.280
I’ll gladly take it.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.280
Better than losing my true self.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.600
All of us…

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.880
We all have the right
to be ourselves.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:24.080
And everyone has the right
to be beautiful.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.240
He’s the first to spark
a revolution in the idol scene.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:32.400
The first LGBTQ+ idol
in the nation of Saenya.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:37.600
Give it up for Prince
and his fearless courage.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.600
Come to think of it,

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.640
I guess I’ve got a streak
of rebellion in me too.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.520
If today we could take down
Somdet Saenyakorn,

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.160
we’d abolish the anti-trans law
from this country right away.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.200
So trans women won’t keep suffering
under it for hundreds of years.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.200
Including me, in the future.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.280
That would be so fabulous.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.000
Mumu.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.480
Papa, where are you going?

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.600
Well, Mama

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.400
just needs to have a little talk with Papa.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.400
Just a bit.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.120
Silent.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.120
Such an unfriendly look.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.160
So this is

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.680
what they call

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.360
braving the tiger with a kind heart.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.400
Mumu, my child.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.000
Mama

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.720
brought some tasty meat for you.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.920
Fresh.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.880
Eat up, sweetie.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.120
Yummy, go on.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.560
I’ll feed you.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.680
Let me feed you.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:25.760
Eat.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.480
Eat.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.080
Good job.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.120
One more piece.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.960
Yummy, good boy.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.400
Good boy, yummy.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.000
Yummy, good boy.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.040
Good boy, so clever.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.080
We’re friends now.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.720
Friends.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.080
Don’t eat me, okay, Mumu?

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.640
Brother Banjong.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.640
Brother Kosol has already
toppled the Count.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.440
Why are you still so tense?

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.720
This overthrow,

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.520
besides the Count

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.960
and the soldiers loyal to him,

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.440
dragged others into prison too.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.080
That includes the servants
in the household.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.400
They knew nothing at all.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.840
They had nothing to do
with the Count’s rebellion.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.040
Yet they had to suffer too.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.120
Are you worried about the servants,
or about Worradej?

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.040
Don’t forget, Worradej is
the Count’s own flesh and blood.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.680
Worradej is with Kosol.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.960
I’m not worried.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.960
Kosol.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:46.920
What?

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.640
What are you doing here?

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.880
If the officials see you,
they’ll send you to dig canals.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.040
I’ve been stuck in my room
for three days. It reeks.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.160
But the reason I came here

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.000
is because I have something
important to tell you.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.160
I promise

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.960
you’ll be glad to hear it.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.840
You’re here to confess
your love to me?

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.920
Oh, no. Of course not.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.720
The reason I came here

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.920
is because

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.920
after thinking it over and over,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.040
if we want to make the world
a better place,

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.120
we should start taking action from today.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.560
So I’ve decided

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.280
that I’ll fight alongside you.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.040
But on one condition.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.280
You have to promise me first,

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.120
once you bring down
Somdet Saenyakorn,

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.800
you’ll abolish the law
that punishes same-sex love.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.720
Of course.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.600
That very law

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.960
was the reason I was removed
as Regent,

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.200
kept from being King,

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.440
and thrown into prison for years.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.720
Fabulous.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.560
We’re on the same page.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.400
Shake on it.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.560
And I’ll propose another new law.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.240
What law?

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.600
Legalizing same-sex marriage.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.000
And who will you marry then?

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.880
Isn’t it obvious?

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.640
There’s only one person.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.800
You.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.320
So, Your Majesty, here you are.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.160
Well, this toy is convenient,
isn’t it, My Lord?

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.720
No need to call out and tire yourself.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.600
You’ve been with my brother
for three days.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.160
You look exhausted.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.560
Seems my brother really wore you out.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.720
Please don’t tease me like that, My Lord.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.080
I’m still a man, My Lord.
This is embarrassing.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.800
But at the Fire Crossing Ritual,

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.120
you kissed Kosol in front of everyone.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.240
Now all of Singhanakhon knows

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.000
you two are lovers.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.520
Still embarrassed?

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.840
We’re not lovers, My Lord.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.240
What I did,

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.440
I only wanted to prove

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.280
Kosol didn’t force me into anything.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.600
I don’t have feelings
beyond that, My Lord.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.200
Please don’t read too much into it, My Lord.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.240
Oh, come on.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.760
I thought I’d finally
get you as a sister-in-law.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.960
Your Majesty…

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.440
By the way, where’s Jade?

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.480
Why isn’t he with you?

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.320
Jade didn’t come with me, My Lord.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.560
Isn’t Jade here with Your Majesty?

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.600
No, he isn’t.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.760
Ever since the Fire Ritual,

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.280
I haven’t seen him at all.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.960
I thought he’d gone with you.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:43.720
Chit, do you know

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.080
where Jade disappeared to?

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.840
I haven’t seen him for three days.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
I heard

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.880
the servants of captured nobles

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.520
were punished along with their masters.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.560
I believe Jade

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.280
might be forced into hard labor

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.840
somewhere, Your Majesty.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.280
Worradej, come search
for Jade with me.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.000
Wait, Your Majesty.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.760
I don’t think this is right, My Lord.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.280
You’re the King.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.400
If you free the wrong person,

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.160
people will criticize you, My Lord.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.280
Let me handle this instead, My Lord.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.560
Once I know something, I’ll send word.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.400
I’ll take my leave, My Lord.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.840
- Move it.
- Put your back into it.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.840
Hurry up, over there.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.960
Don’t slack off, damn it.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.240
Here too, hurry.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.600
- Go, go, faster.
- Come on, load it up.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.840
Come.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.720
A father helps his son.
I’ll help you.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.800
Let’s go.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.080
Can you manage, Dad?

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.440
Yeah, yeah, come on.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.200
Move it, move it.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.720
How are you, son?
How are you feeling?

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.160
Hey, you slacking off?

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.800
Want me to whip you?

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.960
My boy’s not well.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.800
Let him rest a bit, Master.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.040
No way.

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:11.400
If others see him resting,
they’ll rest too.

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:13.000
When will the work get done?

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.000
Then I’ll get chewed out by the boss.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:17.359
- Keep loading.
- How are you, son?

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.520
Enough, enough.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.000
Don’t, don’t.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.040
Get up.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.800
- How do we help him?
- If he can’t, let him die.

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:28.400
If the soldiers find us,
we’ll be dragged in too.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.000
- Forced into labor for sure.
- Enough, enough.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.720
Don’t, don’t hit him.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.880
Dad.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:36.880
Hey, you.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.960
Here are the extra questions they sent.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.200
For today’s interview.
Read them.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.080
Yes, Manager.

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.440
Good job.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.880
- P’Man, hello.
- Hi.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.040
Every time we’re on set, you look tense.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.560
We all know why.

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.560
That big-shot host, right?

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.400
Just avoid him if you can.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.680
How could I?
I have to hand him the interview script.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.080
These are the questions
for today’s interview.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:32.880
Hey.

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.760
What font size is this?

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.240
Fourteen.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.080
Don’t you know that’s too small?
I can’t read it.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.960
For me, it has to be twenty.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.680
Sorry, I’ll go print a new copy right away.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.720
Don’t bother.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.920
You’ve got five minutes.
Write it out for me.

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.800
And make sure I can read it.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.280
Go.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.920
Don’t mess with him.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.360
He’s a host with serious pull.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.880
If he doesn’t like you,

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.040
you’ll be finished overnight.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.240
I’m sorry. I write very slowly.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.000
And my handwriting isn’t neat either.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.920
I’ll just go print a new copy.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.240
You dare defy my orders?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Come.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.280
Master, Master.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:24.960
Father.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.520
Enough, stop.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.720
Father.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.080
- I’m scared.
- Hey!

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.760
Stop right now.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.440
Can’t you see he can’t take it?

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:37.960
What if he dies?

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.720
Master, don’t help me.
I can still go on.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.040
Run away.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.080
Oh…

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.080
So the Count is here.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.720
I’ve been searching for you.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.120
Do you realize you share
your father’s crimes?

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.840
Hey, men. Seize him.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.640
- Stop, let go.
- Don’t.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.920
Don’t hurt Master.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.520
- Let go.
- Release him.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.640
I’ll take him to work
on documents at my manor.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.800
Yes, Count.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.000
Count.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.920
You’re the new governor
of Singhanakhon.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.600
Hurry and thank the Count.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.160
Thank you, Banjong.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.000
Banjong, please help Jade. He’s…

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.240
Jade can’t take it anymore.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.760
If he keeps going, he’ll die for sure.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.480
Please, Banjong, save him.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.200
I’ll take Jade instead.

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.720
Yes, Count.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.160
- Go, Jade.
- Go, Jade, hurry.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.160
Don’t worry about me.
Just go.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.360
- Please, don’t worry.
- Jade!

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.640
Help me, please.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.920
- Help me, please.
- Help me, please.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.160
Please, help me.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.000
- Help me, please.
- Help me, please.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.040
Help me, please.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.640
- You lot, back to work.
- Help me, please.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.720
- Get moving.
- Please, help.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.240
Help me, please.

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.720
Please, help me.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.520
- Help me, please.
- Help me, please.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.920
- Get up. Work.
- Help me, please.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.080
- Get up.
- Help me, please.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.800
Rest for now.

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:42.840
Luckily, Count Banjong saved
the two of you in time.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.840
But Jade’s father and the others

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.160
are still forced to work there, My Lord.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.720
I don’t exactly feel good, My Lord,

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.000
being the only one granted privilege.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.680
We can’t pull them out one by one.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.440
If we really want to help,

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.720
we must change the palace law itself.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.120
But soon enough,

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.000
once we seize power
from Somdet Saenyakorn,

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.480
we’ll rewrite all the laws together.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.920
Including…

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.600
the very existence of the monarchy?

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.520
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.600
Brothers and sisters, listen.

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.160
Whoever wishes to be a soldier,

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.520
come and enlist here.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.880
If we want to change this land,

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.640
to give everyone a better life,

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.200
we must sacrifice now,

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.560
and take the front line.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.520
Join us in battle,

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.680
to fight against injustice.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.320
Whoever wishes to fight alongside us,

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.760
step forward and enlist here.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.720
I’ll take everyone, no exceptions.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.880
All I ask is the heart of a fighter.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.160
Not me. I’d rather die old.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.800
Are you willing
to fight with me?

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.560
No. Go on, son.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.120
And you? Interested?

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.360
I accept women too.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.320
Are you crazy? I’m a lady.
You expect me to fight?

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.400
My husband already died
on the battlefield.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.080
What’s wrong
with all of you?

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:44.560
Don’t you want to
fight for yourself, your

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.760
family, your children,
the ones you love?

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:49.960
Enough, my Lord.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.800
We’ve been recruiting for three days now,

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.600
and not a single person
has joined.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.880
It’s a waste of time.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:58.240
Why is everyone so cowardly,
selfish, and blind?

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.640
Only caring
about themselves.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.960
I think we need
another way.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.840
Worradej.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.200
From now on,
we’ll fight together.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.520
So I want to confess

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.080
what’s been weighing
on my heart.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.760
Otherwise…

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.080
I won’t be at peace.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.040
Is this about you
rejecting my love?

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.080
That… I don’t mind anymore.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.400
Put your heart at ease.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.040
No, not that.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.840
What I need to confess is…

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.440
Didn’t I tell you already?

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.800
Get out of our group.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.600
But Banjong never said
a word against me.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.320
What right do you have
to drive me out?

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.320
Banjong may be
the founder of this group,

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.400
but we all share
equal rights here.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.440
And we’ve already decided

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.600
we don’t welcome you.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:17.880
Go.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.800
I said get out.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.720
Are you deaf
or just stupid?

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.280
Freak.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.280
- Get out.
- Go.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.080
- Get out.
- Go.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.120
- Get out, out.
- I said get out.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.720
- Out.
- Out.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.360
- I said get out, freak.
- Out.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.640
- Drop dead.
- I said get out.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.720
- Go, get out.
- Out, pervert.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.120
- Go.
- Out.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.840
- Go.
- Out.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.400
- Get out.
- Can’t you hear?

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.520
- Out.
- Scum.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.000
- Out.
- Just go.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.920
- Go.
- I told you to get out.

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.160
Freak.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.800
You… you killed Vichai.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.640
- Vichai.
- Vichai.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.520
Vichai!

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.640
Vichai.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.000
- Vichai.
- Vichai.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.440
If you want to live here
with dignity, you must fight.

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.160
Kosol was the one
who taught me that.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.000
He killed our man.

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.480
You can’t keep him
in the group anymore.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.160
I was the one
who killed him.

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.320
I’ll take all the blame.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.560
Drink some water.

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.240
I’m sorry, Worradej.

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.000
I regret having
to do this.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.680
It’s the only way
to stop you from hurting us more.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.360
Banjong.

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.600
I love you.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.680
Carry on our mission.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.160
And the one who shot you
at the palace wall…

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.760
was me.

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.160
Totally shook.

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.640
But now I understand.

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:21.040
You weren’t a traitor.
You never betrayed us.

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.120
I was wrong all along.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.200
So today I’ve come
to apologize.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.480
Can you forgive me?

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.320
It’s… kind of strange,

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:40.360
to forgive someone who tried
to kill me twice that easily.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.200
If you can’t forgive me,

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.080
I’ll understand.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.480
I deserve your anger
and your hate.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.720
I’ll accept it humbly.

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.520
But I forgive you.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.080
Really?

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.520
Really.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:11.920
I understand why you did it,

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.560
out of love for the group
and for the cause.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.520
And you were twisted
by those who despised me.

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:21.880
Let’s just leave the past
where it belongs.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.640
We still have a mission
to fight together.

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.000
If we stay hung up on this,

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.160
we won’t get anything done,
right?

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:33.280
Thank you, Worradej.

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:35.680
Let me hug you.

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.280
Let’s start over.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.400
Worradej.

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.960
Till the end of skies,

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.000
earth and stars
shall meet.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.840
If our love…

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.960
Never ending, never fading.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:29.000
Through the years,
through endless time.

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:33.200
May our love always return,
never torn apart.

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.360
It’s not over yet.

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:42.000
Ugh, I’m going crazy.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.160
Ugh.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.480
If you can’t raise an army,

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:03.120
then find a way to defeat
Somdet Saenyakorn without force.

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.040
That way no blood
needs to be shed.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.640
Oh, child.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.880
You think if I kneel and beg
him to step down,

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.600
he’ll just give up power?

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.680
Dream on.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.080
Who said anything
about kneeling?

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.160
I meant a way
without violence.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.440
Using brains.

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.960
Do you even have one,
big brother?

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:23.760
Why you…

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.880
As if you’re so clever yourself.

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:27.240
If you are,

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.560
then show me right now.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.000
How would you handle
that Somdet?

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.280
I haven’t figured it out yet.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.000
I was only suggesting
an option.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.960
I thought you’d be the one
to come up with it.

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:42.720
If you’ve got no idea,
then don’t speak.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.280
You asked me for advice,
so I had to say something.

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:48.240
If you don’t want my words,
then don’t come next time.

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.480
I thought you’d grown up,

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.720
and might have better ideas
than before.

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.960
Are you calling me thick?

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.880
Then I’ll wait and see
your master plan.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.520
Let’s see how brilliant
it really is.

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.560
But first, get an army
before you brag.

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:06.800
And if I do find one,
what then?

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.880
Then I’ll do whatever you ask of me.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.800
I won’t say no.

00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:26.239
Oh my god, what now?

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:27.360
Come back with me.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.760
No way, I’m not going.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:32.080
With you around I can barely
get any sleep.

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:35.280
I promise I’ll bother you less.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.280
From now on, if you want
or don’t want something,

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.400
just tell me.

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.280
I’ll give in to you in everything.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:42.920
Just come back with me now.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.239
Wait a sec,

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.320
this is weird. What’s going on?

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:48.320
There’s something I want to discuss.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.679
I need your help to figure it out.

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:51.520
About what?

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:53.880
Help me gather troops for battle.

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:56.960
Me? Find soldiers for your fight?

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.360
That’s right.

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.040
Wait, wait, wait.

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.760
You seriously want a kathoey
to recruit an army?

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:16.680
I’m better off gathering dancers for a parade.

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:19.840
Because I know you’ve got brains and wit.

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:22.320
You can think outside the box,

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.160
beyond anything I can predict.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:27.560
I believe this task isn’t beyond you.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.560
Flattering me like that, I’m blushing.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:32.960
Well…

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:34.800
I…

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.280
might…

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.360
just think of something.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.160
If I get some tasty food
in my belly first.

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.240
Here you go.

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.320
Thanks, Auntie.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.880
Oh no, don’t thank me.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.040
I made it as an offering
for the goddess.

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:53.880
What goddess, Auntie?

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.680
I’m just an ordinary person like you.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:59.160
Ordinary people don’t just
walk through fire like that.

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.720
Goddess, no need to hide your true self.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:04.320
The whole town saw
your miracle already.

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.640
You’re the goddess.

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.440
Let me bow to you too.

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.240
That’s what real divinity is like.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:12.080
Never revealing itself.

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:15.200
One blessing from you
will bring me luck.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.520
Touch my head, Goddess.

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.240
Bless me with your hand.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.880
Touch my head, Goddess.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.080
- Goddess!
- Bless me, please!

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:42.120
Touch my head.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.240
Alright, everyone, gather here!

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.200
Come listen, quick!

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:50.120
Brothers and sisters,
gather around!

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.320
Listen up, everyone!

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.640
Goddess Worradej

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.440
will perform a miracle

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.840
at the firewalk ground.

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:59.160
If you wish to witness her glory,
come see for yourselves!

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:03.040
- Let’s go!
- Let’s check it out!

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.480
At the firewalk ground!

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.360
Hurry up!

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:25.280
Truth is, I don’t really like
showing off miracles.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:27.200
It’s not something I want
everyone to see.

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.880
But ever since I walked through
the fire the other day…

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.360
But people kept begging me
to show them something.

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.400
So I just gave them a little taste,
nothing much.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.920
That should be enough.

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:38.840
But today,

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:41.480
someone’s going to perform with me.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.680
Lord Kosol.

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.080
Me?

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:53.720
Yes, you.

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.480
But if people know me,

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.600
they’ll think we planned this.

00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.760
You’re still the best choice.

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:02.080
You’re known to be straightforward.

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:04.160
The villagers will believe you
no matter what.

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.560
They know you wouldn’t trick them.

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.280
No. I won’t do it.

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:16.840
Then just tell me quickly,

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.120
what do I have to do?

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:19.240
Not telling.

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:22.280
First you have to promise me

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.560
that you’ll work with me

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.280
and do everything I say.

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.520
If it really brings us more troops,

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:36.040
then I’ll do whatever you say.

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:42.600
Fine.

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.000
I’ll do it.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.560
What do you want me to do?

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.680
I… will summon a deity

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:56.560
to descend and inhabit Lord Kosol’s body.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.680
And once

00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:00.760
the deity has taken residence in Lord Kosol,

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:04.040
he’ll speak in the divine tongue.

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:08.960
I’ll translate for everyone to understand.

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:12.080
Divine tongue? I don’t speak that.

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.960
You won’t be the one speaking.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.800
The deity will speak.

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:18.840
I just need to borrow your body.
Just stay still.

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.880
Everyone, are you ready?

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:23.840
- I’m not ready, Worradej.
- Ready.

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:29.800
Om… masikala, mutela, matelu…

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.960
Muteli…

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:36.560
Muteli…

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:40.480
Muteli…

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:49.040
The deity has descended.

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.000
O Divine One,

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.240
I have heard

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:55.240
that you have words to share with the villagers.

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.600
Please speak,

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:59.280
I will translate for them to hear.

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:09.240
The deity says that from heaven above,

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.760
He has looked down and seen,

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:14.200
the suffering and hardship
of all the villagers.

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.560
Living their lives in misery,

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.440
with no freedom of their own,

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:28.600
treated as property of lords and nobles.

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.440
So the deity has come down

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.240
to reveal the way

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.520
for you all to be free,

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:42.760
to live your lives in liberty.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.400
Do you want to know what this way is?

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.240
- Yes!
- We want to know!

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.920
The deity says

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:57.240
we must rise and fight,

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:58.720
fight against the power

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.840
that oppresses us.

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:03.280
Don’t hope for anyone else
to fight for us.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.560
We must fight for our children,

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.000
for our parents and kin,

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:10.200
for the families and generations to come.

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:14.360
Who here agrees

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.280
and will fight by my side?

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:19.760
Raise your voices now!

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.920
- Me! Me!
- Me!

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Me!

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.240
And those of you who agree with me,

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:30.840
please step this way and sign your names!

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:34.120
Come, come, right this way!

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.560
Oh, Kosol.

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:10.400
Where’ve you been? Out exercising?

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:11.840
No.

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.760
I went to deal with Chaiyached,

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.240
for daring to insult me.

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:17.080
And now, it’s your turn.

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:21.480
Wait, hold it, stop, stop, stop!

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.200
Why are you acting out like this?

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.400
I went through all that trouble
to get you soldiers,

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:27.280
and you’re still coming at me?

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:30.240
Because you made me do
weird things without asking first!

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.920
Do you know how humiliated I felt?

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.560
Talking nonsense like that
in front of everyone.

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:40.120
If I’d told you beforehand,
you wouldn’t have done it.

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:43.240
So forcing your hand
was the best method.

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.000
And anyway, my method

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.520
got you soldiers in the end, didn’t it?

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:49.280
Fine. Then consider your merit

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.000
enough to cancel your fault.

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:54.240
Oh, Māsakra…

00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:58.960
What are you even saying?

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.720
Are you mocking me right now?

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:08.800
Merciful deity, please don’t do anything!

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.480
Oh divine one, ahhh!

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.400
Kosol.

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:14.880
What is it?

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:16.800
The villagers who enlisted yesterday,

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.080
there aren’t enough. Some are sick,

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.240
some have children.

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:22.000
After the screening, barely any remain.

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.720
We’ll need many more.

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:27.280
Otherwise, there’s no way
we can defeat His Majesty’s army.

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.440
You’ve got it wrong, we’re here to work,

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.480
not to play around.

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:08.520
Banjong.

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.320
- Where are you going?
- To sit with Worradej.

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.440
That poem, why did you write it for me?

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.200
Because I wanted to make amends.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:18.200
What’s with all this chatter? I need sleep.

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.880
Even if we’ve secured allies
from other cities,

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:22.240
I still don’t think it’s enough.

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:23.840
Right now, we’re here.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.600
And we’re heading to
the mountain-foot village, which is here.

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:27.920
- Everyone, get down!
- Ahh!

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:29.560
We must get out of this area fast.

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.520
Stay close together, follow me.

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:34.840
Muteli.

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:37.640
(The deity has descended)
The deity has descended.

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.920
(Maybe he just wants a good shot)
Perhaps the heavens above

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.680
(Maybe he just wants a good shot)
Maybe he wants it

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:46.280
with rain falling in this scene.

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.040
Don’t you understand plain speech?

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.560
You filthy queer.

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:50.880
(Feel the pain for the Count)

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.640
(Smack, right on target)

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.680
(Go easy on him, please)

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:55.600
That’s enough, sir.

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:58.200
He’s already got wounds in plenty of places.

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.280
Hsss...

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:01.440
Everyone, eyes over here.

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:03.040
(Burns straight to the heart)

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:19.120
(Adapted:I'm the Most Beautiful Count in Siam,
standing at Tha Phra chewing on a pen.)

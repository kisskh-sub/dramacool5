(Duke of Changyi's Mansion)

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:04.920
Qingge,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.800
based on the censor records you gave me,

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.150
I've put together a list.

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:09.570
Here, take a look.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.310
Qingge?

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.200
Duke.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.470
Mm.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.280
Come on.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.240
Let's go out.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.690
Take a look.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.680
Fine items.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.550
Duke, if I may.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.740
(Yan Mansion)
You don't seem like

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.120
you're here to find someone.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.400
Then what do I look like?

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.470
Walking into a trap on my own?

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.430
Or trying to curry favor with gifts?

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.080
Neither of those.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.310
You look like

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.840
you've come to propose marriage.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.000
Lord Yan has

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.150
quite the peculiar temper.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.630
And he's an Imperial Censor.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.110
I can't afford to be discourteous.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.260
(Yan Mansion)

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.000
I was about to see you.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.950
Where is my daughter?

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.080
Didn't she return home?

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.530
I had told her to leave Chang'an.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.400
Yesterday...

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.790
You're the last man she met.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:24.590
Now she's missing.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.960
What did you say to her?

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.570
I didn't say much to her.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.970
Why did you send her away?

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.470
No matter where you've hidden her, Duke,

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.720
or what intentions you have,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.280
please understand the heart of a father.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.560
I ask you to return my daughter to me.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.110
I didn't know she's missing

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.400
until I came to see you.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.400
You let her leave Chang'an.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.560
What's your intention?

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.710
If you hadn't let her leave,

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:50.750
she wouldn't have vanished.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.080
It must be your strictness

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.190
that made her upset.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.100
I never came to take her from you,

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.720
yet you accuse me of wrongdoing.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:00.560
She promised

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.800
she'll hand those things over to you

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.880
and then stay away from this mire.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.950
Those things?

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.240
What is this?

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.800
I asked my father
for the records of officials.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.000
To secure the throne,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.870
you'll need them.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.390
Why are you telling me all this,

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.120
as if you're saying farewell?

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:23.870
You fool.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.740
Li Qi, go find her.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.630
Mm.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.780
(Yan Mansion)

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.000
Quickly, all of you.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.000
The Empress Dowager is coming.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.370
If she spots any speck of dust,

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.470
you'll lose a hand.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.920
In the Palace, rules must be observed.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.120
Keep your head down.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.430
And don't speak out of turn.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:51.830
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.580
Watch your tongue.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.190
Or you might lose it.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.080
Move it.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:01.790
You,

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.640
go sweep over there.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.520
Oh.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.280
What are you doing? Stop dawdling.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.560
Hurry up.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.560
Miss.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.960
Miss.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.630
Why are you just sitting here?

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.670
Go get to work.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:26.710
Or you'll get scolded.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.280
My cat has gone missing.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.850
A cat? When did it go missing?

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.350
Many years ago.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.730
I've been here waiting for it to return.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.520
Miss, once enough years have passed,

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.190
those we've lost will never come back.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.520
All the more so when it's a cat.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:42.670
That one

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.510
was once my only friend here.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.210
How could any other ever replace it?

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.900
(Auspicious Signs)

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.070
There's no use dwelling on the past,

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.680
no matter how much you regret.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.180
Do you wish to regret the present
in the future?

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.920
Tell me what that cat looked like.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.250
I'll get you an even cuter one.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.430
You're new here, aren't you?

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.270
Mm.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.160
That's why you dare speak to me.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.110
Uh?

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.140
(Duke of Changyi's Mansion)

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.040
Have you found her?

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.880
Not yet.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.000
Go search quickly.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.200
Western Market, Dongsheng.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.140
South Gate, North Gate.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.000
Go find her, everyone.

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.870
- Yes.
- Go.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:24.720
You must find her

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.040
no matter what.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:28.670
- Lord Gong.
- Duke.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.360
What's going on?

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.650
People are coming and going.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.020
It's an important day.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.270
How's your preparation?

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.720
You must not grow careless.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.960
What is the matter?

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.510
Have you forgotten?

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.850
You'll meet Empress Dowager Shangguan.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.630
She'll enthrone you as Crown Prince.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.260
(Duke of Changyi's Mansion)

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.270
Tell the Empress Dowager,

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.560
I'm not going today.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.430
This matter is of great importance.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.670
How can you not show up?

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.360
Qingge has gone missing.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.760
No.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.630
If I can't find her,

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.920
I won't see anyone.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.890
This…

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.600
Go.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.440
Lord Gong.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.630
Quickly gather a team of guards.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.680
Escort me and the Duke into the Palace.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.000
Lord Gong.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:16.510
Duke, don't worry.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.070
Take my badge.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.850
Rally everyone left in the residence,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.830
including the servants.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.210
Have the artist
paint portraits of Lady Qingge.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.570
Go to where Lady Qingge went missing.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.380
Search along the streets from there.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.290
Remember, this is Chang'an.

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.310
We must keep this quiet.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.430
Make inquiries with caution.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.910
Understood.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.000
Go on.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:46.070
You two, come with me.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.560
Yes.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:50.630
Duke.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.750
I know of your bond with Lady Qingge.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.720
But the most urgent matter is this.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.870
You must go to Changle Palace at once.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.160
Only after meeting the Empress Dowager

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.120
will you be enthroned as Crown Prince.

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.830
Only then will your position be rightful.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.950
If we delay the appointed time,

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.450
it could lead to grave trouble.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.110
The gifts are all prepared.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.560
I'll go get changed.

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:18.900
Duke, you're wise.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.700
Attend to the Duke, help him change.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:31.260
(Duke of Changyi's Mansion)

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.360
I pay my respects, Empress Mother.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:46.750
I hope you're well.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.280
Rise.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:55.900
I've brought you

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.370
gold, pearls, and fine silks as a token

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.850
of my filial respect.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.480
You are thoughtful indeed.

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:04.630
I too have a gift for you.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.790
I heard you have a fine horse,

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:12.840
so I prepared this gift.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.790
When you ride one day, wear it at your waist,

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.150
and you will look gallant.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.360
Thank you, Mother.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.870
The Duke of Changyi
bows with ceremony.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.750
Truly a model of filial devotion.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:36.240
I'm deeply impressed.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:39.750
I hope Your Highness and the Empress Dowager

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.150
will honor and support each other

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.410
and together ensure the realm prospers.

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:45.810
From this day forth,

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:49.270
the people of the State of Changyi

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.550
may enter the Palace
to learn its etiquette

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:54.630
and prepare

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:56.620
for your future paths.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:58.990
I heard we're moving into the Palace.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:09:59.800
By then,

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.440
all delicacies will be at our fingertips.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.380
All thanks to the Duke.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:03.500
Remember this, everyone,

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.130
you must follow the decrees of the court.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.410
Once you're in the Palace,

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:08.720
you won't be free to come and go.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.790
Mingyou, Han Zeng, cross.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:10.630
Hey, Lord Wang,

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.640
what's this about?

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:12.940
Mingyou, Han Zeng, cross.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.620
Zhang Chongguo, Zhang Anshi, cross.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:15.870
Lu Wenshu, Li Guang, circle.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:16.870
Duke, eat well

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:17.710
and take care.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.670
If I'm gone,
who else could protect you,

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:20.410
Duke?

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:21.370
No need for protection.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:22.940
- Mingyou, Han Zeng, Chongguo,
- Heng.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.350
- Anshi, Su Chang.
- You're back.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:25.240
- Lu Wenshu.
- Heng.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.480
- Li Guang, Huang Ba.
- What?

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.480
Why do you seem so distracted?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.080
I still have so much I want to tell you.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.390
Fan Mingyou, Han Zeng,
Zhao Chongguo, cross.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.840
Zhang Anshi, Su Chang, cross.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:40.030
Lu Wenshu, Li Guang, circle;
Huang Ba, tick.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:41.350
Heng.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.410
How did you know I drafted this list?

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:45.250
Shh.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:46.960
Keep saying your farewells.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.030
I won't intrude.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.030
Heng.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.610
Heng.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:53.550
What's wrong, Heng?

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.480
- Duke.
- It's nothing, really.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.320
Stay here, be good.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:57.320
I'll come find you later.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.080
Duke, if I'm not here,

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.150
who else can keep you safe?

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:03.200
By Lord Huo's command,

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.830
Wang Heng is to be executed on the spot.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.270
Ah!

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.130
Heng!

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.180
(June 28, 74 BC)

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:18.700
(June 25, 74 BC)

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:20.840
Everyone, rest early tonight.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:28.390
Ah.

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:30.960
Now listen to what I'm about to say.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.150
First, I have urgent matters tomorrow.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.240
So I can't go to Chang'an.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.360
When you enter the city, cry.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:36.820
If you can't, stare into the sun.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.030
Second,

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:39.540
do not get angry with Yan Yannian.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:40.390
Yan Yannian?

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.870
Who's that?

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:42.910
That's my father.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.890
I know, let me finish.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.060
Third, meet the Empress Dowager on time.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.080
Fourth,

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.790
all of you will be summoned to the Palace.

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:50.000
Just go.

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.920
I'll come find you

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.390
in your mansion. Remember that?

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.960
- Uh?
- What?

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:54.990
Keep that in mind.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.750
Got it.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:57.960
Go over everything I told you.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:58.840
I'll come find you.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.280
I have matters, bye.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:02.460
Yan Yannian is your father.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:04.240
Yan Yannian is your father.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.340
I can remember everything.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:07.910
Yan Yannian is your father.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.130
Yan Yannian is your father.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.360
Such refined taste for someone so young.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:17.630
I'm Wang Heng.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.290
I've been expecting you.

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:21.670
Lord Wang, Lord Huo wants to see you.

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:24.000
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.080
It never hurts to arrive early.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.590
The next meeting will be in ten days.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.440
Lord Wang, please remember the date

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.390
and attend on time.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.600
(It will be the best chance
to rein in him.)

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.870
I'll remember, milord.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:37.830
After you, Lord Huo.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.210
- Morning.
- (Their connections)

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:40.560
- Morning.
- (run far too deep.)

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:43.170
- (One wrong step would kill me.)
- Lord Wang is talented.

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:45.670
- (Luckily, I can be reborn.)
- He will make it big.

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:48.200
- (I must use this to map out)
- He will discuss state affairs

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.280
- (the factions.)
- with us.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.670
We should send trusted scouts to check

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:53.470
- (Five, four,)
- for hidden dangers.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:54.410
(three,)

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:55.260
(two,)

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.120
(one.)

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:56.960
(Now.)

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.480
Gentlemen, please continue.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.870
I'll be right back.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.210
(Even his restroom breaks are timed.)

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:05.960
Generals,

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.830
I have a request.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.990
I hold an order
from the Duke of Changyi.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:12.790
Once he ascends the throne,

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.600
I hope you'll aid him
in quelling the traitors.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.810
Does the Great General know of this?

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.120
This is from the Duke of Changyi.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.200
You bear the duty
of protecting the Duke.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.190
Please lend your support to the Duke.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.390
Better wait until Great General returns.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.090
(They listen to him on everything.)

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.050
(Blind followers.)

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.960
If the Duke shows
signs of imperial scheming,

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.080
what's your view on it?

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.950
Even the most cunning imperial schemes

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.220
is just child's play before Lord Huo.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:41.130
If the New Emperor clashed
with Lord Huo,

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:42.600
how would you choose, milord?

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.020
Lord Huo would surely persuade him.

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.470
Lord Wang, what brings you here

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.330
at this late hour?

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.550
Huo Guang acts against order,

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:50.510
usurping power.

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:52.350
The Crown Prince intends to unseat him.

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:54.680
Lord Li, will you side
with the Crown Prince?

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.320
Oh, Lord Wang, say no more.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.000
General Huo has given his all
for the Han Empire.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.300
This must be a misunderstanding.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.120
Lord Li,

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.440
will you support the Crown Prince?

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:03.440
Are you out of your mind?

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.820
As Capital Commandant,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.140
you should protect Chang'an.

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:07.910
Who exactly do you side with?

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:09.360
Lord Wang, why press me so?

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.600
What protection of Chang'an?

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.990
It's just following orders.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:13.670
I have no choice but to obey.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:15.600
How would I have the right to fight, milord?

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:16.870
Milord, if you must kill,

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.760
then take my life first.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:23.160
That way, I'll no longer live in fear.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:24.960
Go on, do it.

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:26.390
Well, you are straightforward.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.030
I won't press you.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:30.590
Forget it.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.240
(He's choosing to protect himself.)

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.240
Crown Prince will unseat Huo Guang.

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:39.080
What is your counsel, Lord Xu?

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:39.940
It's my duty

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:41.040
to support the Crown Prince.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:42.360
I only wish to remind you,

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.750
there's no secret in Chang'an,

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.660
because there's always a turncoat.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.600
We had best think it over again.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.670
Seize the traitor Wang Heng.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.960
How would I have the right to fight?

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.830
- Take him away.
- Game of thrones.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.540
Fence-sitters are indeed everywhere.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.540
Take him away.

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:07.680
You just spat wine on me.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:08.820
(74 BC, June 28)

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.300
(74 BC, June 25)

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:27.830
♪Watch the storm;

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:29.430

WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.200
Her Highness refuses to call off
the wedding between you and Lady Pa.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.480
They are preparing for the occasion.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.840
We have no choice but to part.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.240
Let us savor happiness in this sanctuary

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.560
until the very last day.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.760
I want to be with you like this forever.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.200
"Memoir of Rati"?

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.520
Whenever you miss me,
write in this memoir.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.920
Save every memory for me.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.320
PARIS, FRANCE

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.440
5 YEARS LATER

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.600
Mother Buaphan.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.440
These past five years,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.160
Thee has written me numerous letters,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.319
but I never received any of them.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.360
Is that true?

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.440
Thee left me a message
in Mother Buaphan's letter.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.960
He sent lots of letters.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.280
Why did you do it?

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.880
Tell me why.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.880
Theerathon's father sent me a letter.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.160
I know what was going on between
Theerathon and you.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.200
You're an advisor to the ambassador now.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.360
You are progressing in your career,

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.280
and you could become
a special ambassador in the future

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.320
if you prove that you're a true Frenchman,
worthy to represent your nation.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.520
You are no longer Siamese, Rati.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.040
Don't let this trivial matter
ruin everything.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.760
Is it the most important thing?

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.320
Isn't the most important thing
a father and his child?

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.960
I love Thee.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.880
Rati!

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.840
You despise my love for Thee.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.560
When you and Mother Rung fell in love,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.800
you faced many obstacles too, did you not?

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.080
Speak French.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.600
I know it isn't ideal for a Siamese lady
to marry a foreigner.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.800
Is that not true?

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.040
Despite what you felt at the time
and how much disdain you received,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.960
you fought through it,

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.480
in the name of love,

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.320
for permission to marry Mom.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.600
Belle and I cherish your love
for each other.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.440
Now I am begging you for a chance

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.240
for you to cherish my love too.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.760
I know you understand me, even if I am
speaking in the Siamese tongue.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.160
Unless you intentionally choose not to.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.000
SIAM

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.800
Hello.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.000
Hello.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.880
Allow me.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.280
Are you looking for someone?

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.080
No.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.280
It is nice to see you, Professor Rati.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.320
How was your journey?

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.720
It was smooth sailing.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.920
MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.880
To the new arrivals,

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.960
congratulations are in order for
the new member

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.440
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Count Suratheetamtanapich.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.160
-Thank you very much, and see you soon.
-See you soon.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.400
Thee!

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.680
Mr. Rati.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.320
I didn't know you were back in Siam.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.600
I…

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.600
-Thee and I…
-Professor.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.600
Will you let me treat you to a meal?

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.400
I must get back to the Legation
with the ambassador, sir.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.640
I shall talk to the ambassador
myself, then.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.560
It will take no more than
a mere hour for a meal.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.080
I will provide you with transport back to
the Legation immediately after.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.120
You should also join us, sir.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.880
It will be a good chance to discuss
the meeting we had just now.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.520
-I'm afraid I have other…
-I won't waste too much of your time.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.240
I nearly forgot.
I have another engagement this afternoon.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.560
Would you be kind enough to give
our professor a ride to the Legation?

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:26.920
-Sir.
-Sir.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.200
Pull over, please.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.320
Don't you have something to say?

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.720
Do you have a question?

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.840
Why?

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.720
Why did you disappear?

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.480
Why did you not write me back
even a single time?

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.560
It was long ago.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.080
There is no point in bringing it up now.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.040
I need to understand

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.440
so I can get over it.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.200
Please consider how your words
would make Lady Pa feel, Thee.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.520
You don't love me anymore, do you?

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.120
It was all in the past.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.800
No matter how good my reasons are,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.120
I cannot turn back time.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.120
Don't tell lies
in front of the Mai Maan Shrine.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.520
What do you want me to say?

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.320
You're married now, Thee.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.520
If I were to tell you

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.520
that I never received any of your letters

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.080
because my father kept them,

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.520
would it change anything?

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.640
Even if it would,

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.000
I wouldn't want it to.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.920
Because you have a wife now.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.480
I don't have a wife.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.160
I'm not married.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.760
You should know that
if you have read my letters.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.640
Yes.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.480
But that was years ago,

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.920
and you have given me back
this navaratna ring.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.360
I saw you and Lady Pa with your child.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.560
What was I to think except that--

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.400
The child belongs to Lady Pa
and her husband.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.120
Why did you return this ring then?

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.240
I didn't know what was going on.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.280
I didn't know whether you had forgotten me
or moved on to someone else.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.200
If you had stopped loving me,

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.000
I felt I should return this ring to you

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.160
so you could give it
to the person you loved.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.920
That was why I asked
Mother Buaphan for help.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.640
I knew you would read her letters.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Because of her letter,

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.360
I learned that you have
always thought of me.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:13.880
I only got to read all 28
of your letters recently.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.560
Why didn't you ever write to me yourself?

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.400
I did.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.520
But my father intercepted them.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.440
So you are not in love with someone else?

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.320
Are you?

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.640
I have belonged to you

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.520
from the first second we met,

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.400
and I still do now.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.800
Thee.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.480
I've missed you so much.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.920
I've missed you too.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.920
I did not expect
the situation to be like this.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:24.200
Can you tell me what happened
after I left for France?

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.000
Didn't you say you'd read my letters?

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.680
Reading it and hearing it are
two different things.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.080
I want to hear how you felt about it too.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.200
Please, Thee.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.320
I volunteered for the war in Europe.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.000
It was dangerous,

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.920
but it was also the only way I could avoid
punishment for refusing to marry.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.520
Come help me.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.680
Mother…

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.800
What about Lady Pa?

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.640
You don't need to worry about her.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.320
She's a progressive lady.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.680
Lady Pa disappeared
the night of the wedding.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.840
She became a nun for a long time

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.040
to avoid the punishment of refusing
the royal matrimonial water.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.360
No one could get her to leave the nunnery.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.000
She only left it when I returned from war.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:50.200
If I must marry for anything but love,
I would rather abandon all hopes of love.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.000
I really respect her for that.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.560
I could say the same about you.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.240
I respect your grit.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.960
Five years without my letters,

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:08.920
and you put up with it.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.040
What a heart of steel.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.280
If it were me,

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:18.760
my heart would be torn to shreds
within five days.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.800
My heart was just as torn

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.200
as all the little shreds
your heart was reduced to.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.600
No matter how difficult this is,

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.520
both of our efforts
will make this love possible.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:41.880
Rati.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.600
Will you

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.800
put this ring on my finger

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.640
once more?

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.800
I have been told

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.160
that you are no longer
just an interpreter,

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.440
but also the secretary to
the French diplomatic mission?

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.120
You're good.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.880
Just like Lady Rung once was.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.320
Everything I learned,

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.400
I learned from Mother Rung, sir.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.760
You sound just like her.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.280
That is indeed overpraising me,
Your Highness.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.920
You should call me "Grandfather."

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.600
You're the son of Lady Rung.

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.680
Lady Rung was my daughter.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.280
That naturally makes you my grandson.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.360
Or would you rather not be associated
with an old man like me?

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.520
Of course I don't mind, Your Highness.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:37.400
It's just that I was an orphan

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.800
and I never thought…

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.320
Call me Grandfather from now on.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.320
Thank you, Grandfather.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.280
Rati!

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.920
Grandfather,
you barely ever let me hug you.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.800
What does that one mean?

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.160
It means nothing at all.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.760
Did you do what I asked you to do?

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.200
There is nothing Mom Luang Dechapatrapee,

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.280
the best translator
at Echo de L'Assomption,

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.160
cannot do, sir.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:43.240
His Highness has asked us to acquire
a gift for you, Professor Rati.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.120
A gift?

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.280
Yes, sir.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.880
In three, two, one.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:07.960
Mother Buaphan.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.360
Mom!

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.600
Joi, my son.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.280
Joi.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.480
Did you like your present?

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:34.440
Buaphan, I have officially adopted
your son into the Suriyakorn family.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.240
You don't have to go away anymore.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.880
Live here and take care of this place.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:58.640
I will take care of it
for the rest of my life, Your Highness.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.760
Wow.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:21.800
My house. It's been so many years,
and it doesn't look one bit older.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.440
I have this place kept in order
at all times

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.640
in case you come back one day.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.040
Jam?

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:33.680
Mr. Rati?

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.520
-Jam!
-Mr. Rati!

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:38.920
What brought you here, sir?

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.320
I've missed you.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.160
I didn't think
I'd ever see you again, sir.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.480
I've missed you too.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.440
Kui!

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.560
Yes?

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:52.720
Kui, come here!

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.240
-Mr. Rati is here!
-Mr. Rati!

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.200
Kui.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.080
Who is that you're holding?

00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.480
This is Kam, sir.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.000
Jam's and my son.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.920
Say hello to Mr. Rati, dear.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.240
Hi.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.160
Hello.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.440
What an adorable little thing.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.280
Jam always complains about
how much she misses you, sir.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.120
"When I think about this,

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.720
I can't help but think about the days
we spent together."

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.880
Me too.

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.520
I still remember the first day we met
at the temple fair.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:38.000
"I can recall vividly the first day
I met you at the temple fair."

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.720
We think alike.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.600
Thee.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.080
Can you not read it out loud?

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:52.640
I want to peruse every letter
you wrote to me but never sent.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.640
You barely included endearments.

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.840
How could I have?

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.880
I thought you were married
to someone else.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.600
I saved all those endearments inside
till they nearly overflowed.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.240
You are free to say them now.

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.560
Do not tease me.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.000
Keep reading.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:31.960
I'm not teasing you.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.840
But my eyes refuse to do what I tell them

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.000
because they work directly
under my heart's honest desires.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.480
Please keep on reading them out loud then.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:46.640
Shout if you must.
I won't stop you anymore.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.920
I'll read them right here then.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.520
Did you have to wait long?

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.040
You're smiling reading your own work…

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.160
Have you lost your mind?

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.640
Mek.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.200
Give that here.

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.280
You're going to drive me crazy.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.840
My Young Master really is
a good translator.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.200
I'm nothing compared to you, Monsieur Mek.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.400
You're the translator for a ministry.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:17.920
I'm just a regular translator
at a private company.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.800
You'll get over it.

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.200
Are you busy today?

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.640
-What plan do you have in mind?
-Let's visit Lord Ruj.

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:38.120
You want him to read your work, don't you?

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.840
Yes, but…

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.600
My father did you wrong.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.280
I'll be there with you.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.640
I know your father hates me,

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.320
but I'll make him love--

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:56.760
No.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.320
"Love" is too strong a word.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.480
I'll make him at least begin to like me.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.040
I know it's difficult,

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.960
but I want to make it happen.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.280
You can do it.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.200
How come you're so certain?

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.280
Even I

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.440
like the heck out of you.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.360
How could my father

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:45.720
not like you too?

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.000
Hey, did you have to do that
for every word?

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.760
Is that how much you like me?

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.000
You don't believe me?

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.360
That's enough.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.360
Shall we go?

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.720
Let's go.

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:22.760
Here.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:42.920
Thank you.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.120
Thank you.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.920
-Flowers?
-All right.

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.240
Thee, look.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.320
Will you hold him for a second?

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.720
Can I see that?

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.240
Hello.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.000
Isn't it beautiful?

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.320
Thanks.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.200
You have been made one of the advisors
for the diplomatic mission?

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.480
Are you happy for me?

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.880
Why did you transfer to
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs?

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.400
I promised you in front of
the Mai Maan Shrine

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.080
that I would do whatever it takes
to make our love possible.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.000
Do you remember?

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:17.960
Yes.

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.000
I can finally fulfill my promise.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:23.760
Three months from now,
I will travel with the diplomatic mission

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.920
to discuss the relationship between
Siam and France.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.000
You asked me to go to France
with you once.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.520
I can finally go with you.

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.520
Thank you

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:43.000
for getting us one step closer
to being together.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.000
It is me, Grandmother.

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:16.440
I am here to say my farewells
before I depart for France.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:26.440
I must travel to Paris and stay for a long
time as part of the diplomatic mission.

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.160
I don't know when I will be back in Siam.

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:35.320
The sea voyage could also be dangerous.

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.240
If it is not too much trouble,

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.400
will you allow me to say goodbye

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.280
and ask for a blessing?

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.480
Will you please let me hug you
one last time before I go?

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.560
Well then…

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:33.400
I must say goodbye from here.

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.160
I won't be around anymore…

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.320
but I will always pray for
your good health.

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.720
Eat well.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:57.200
Do not stress or fret over anything.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.720
I want you to be happy.

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.120
I promise

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:17.720
I will write home often.

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:24.400
Goodbye, Grandmother.

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.080
I love you.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.600
Are you training for a match or something?

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.080
Is your salary not enough to support you?

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:31.440
I would not stop practicing muay
even if I became a millionaire.

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:33.880
You must really love it.

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:35.800
Yes.

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.280
I love it.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:41.920
I love muay.

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.400
Wasn't it muay that brought us together?

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.320
I'll practice too.

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.000
Good. Let's do it.

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:58.280
Hey!

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.120
Mek. Hold on.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.520
Mek! I said hold on!

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.000
Ow!

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:05.920
Dech!

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:11.239
I told you to hold on.

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.679
Are you in pain? I thought you'd
be able to dodge it. I'm sorry.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.360
I'm fine. No need to apologize.

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:21.679
I can take it.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:27.639
Muay brought us together, after all.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.120
Chew on some cloves.

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:42.600
They really help with pain.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.040
Cloves smell awful.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.120
I much prefer flowers.
Do you have them?

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.480
Stick with cloves.

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:55.520
Here.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.160
It was too big.
Can you give me a smaller piece?

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:09.640
Here.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.720
It was too tough to chew.

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.960
-Can you give me a softer piece?
-Are you messing with me?

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.320
I'm not.

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.520
I just want to be pampered.

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:24.520
You want to be pampered?

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.800
How so?

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:47.480
Like this?

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:05.680
It isn't soft yet.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.080
I'd say it is quite soft already.

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.200
RATI, THEE

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.400
Thee and Rati.

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:56.040
It feels so nice to see our names
next to each other like this.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.200
Thee.

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.320
I'm just happy.

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.960
I want these flowers
to remain intact forever.

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.200
I doubt that is possible.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:17.640
They will be gone
with the wind and the rain.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.720
This love is ours.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.600
It does not answer to anything else.

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:30.080
Whatever must go will go.

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:33.120
But I won't allow us to fade away.

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:42.360
Thee-Rati. We will never fade.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.040
Our story will be etched in here

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.320
for all eternity.

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:58.120
Eternity means forever.

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.400
Bloom soon.

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.880
I didn't know you grew flowers.

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:49.640
What?

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:50.680
You don't like them?

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:56.840
Are they for me?

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.360
I'm just keeping them.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:07.280
But if you want them,
they're yours to take.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.840
I don't know which flowers you like,

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:13.960
so I planted a lot of them.

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:19.600
Well, you would fear judgment if I were
to give you just one, wouldn't you?

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:24.040
So take the whole bed of them.

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.320
Take them all.

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:26.960
If you want.

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.200
Wouldn't it be easier
to just say you love me?

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.440
No, it wouldn't.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.800
Say it.

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.560
-"It."
-Mek!

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:49.520
Dech!

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:50.440
What is it?

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:52.440
Tell me

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.120
you love me.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.600
You are talking nonsense.

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:05.240
Go away.

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.080
I'm watering these flowers.

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.880
You're in the way.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.360
Go away.

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.880
Go on!

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.720
Where should I go?

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.120
You said these flowers are all mine.

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:29.920
And so are you.

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.160
So I might as well water you too.

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.320
Dech, stop it!

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.400
Dech! Dech, I don't want to be soaked!

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.320
Dech! Dech!

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.920
Would you hit me?

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.200
I would not!

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.320
Dech!

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.680
Dech!

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:51.720
Stop it. Stop. Stop!

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.440
Call me simply by my name,
just as I call you by yours.

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:01.680
If you insist,

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:03.160
Dech.

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:07.720
Could we still be friends
if I were to tell you

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:08.960
I fancy you?

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.600
MONSIEUR MEK WILL BE A MODEL STUDENT
TO YOUNG MASTER DECH.

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:18.160
I want to be with you like this forever.

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:24.200
I…

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.760
I want to be with you too.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:31.880
Dech, you!

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:46.360
Hold on.

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.360
The smell of bunga.

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:26.560
I'm asking you to make some
bunga rumpai with me.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.400
We need some sachets.

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:44.720
No.

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:46.840
I got it.

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:53.640
Darling.

00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:02.560
I hope I am not dreaming.

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:31.160
The Memoir of Rati

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:33.880
is written by two people.

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.320
It records moments of joy,

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.280
capturing the day we met

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.480
and the time we spent together.

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:49.760
Our story is a testament to how heaven
can send one person to love another

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:52.080
with an unwavering heart.

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:54.360
What a wonderful thing it is.

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:59.720
The day has finally come
for us to be together.

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:03.080
To live side-by-side
the way our hearts desire.

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:08.600
It is the day this memoir
turns to its final pages

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:12.800
and etches itself into our hearts
for all eternity.

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:25.400
Thee.

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:26.680
I forgot something.

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:28.720
Let me fetch it.

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:53.720
Long ago in the kingdom
Of King Chakri, full of wisdom

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:56.080
Lived a young and beautiful dame

00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:00.720
With a face that makes its own name

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:04.480
Her body was beyond sultry

00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:11.960
As if she were born of a deity

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:18.280
Sweet words poured out from every man

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:22.480
Trying their best to win her hand

00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:24.760
It is called Nang Phattalung.

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:27.440
Their words were sweet yet bitter
Like lies coated with sugar…

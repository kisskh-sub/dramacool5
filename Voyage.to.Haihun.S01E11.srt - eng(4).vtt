- Duke.
- How is it?

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.430
No sign of him in the north or south.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.140
Li Qi has gone out of the city
to search.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.430
Duke.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.340
Well?

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.560
Nothing in the west either.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.000
Search again.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.710
Comb through all of Hongnong
if you must.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:42.550
Yes.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.560
Duke, what has happened?

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.350
Wang Heng is missing.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.730
Did you search the whole area?

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.630
He didn't come back last night.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.160
Duke, I searched
all over the east of the city.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.430
Still no sign of Heng.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.100
Lord Wang is usually very cautious.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.310
He should be fine.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.580
Duke.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.900
Lord Shi is seething with anger.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.910
He urgently needs you.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.290
What a strong smell of wine.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.310
How could Lord Wang be like this?

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.150
Lord Shi.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.440
What's the matter?

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.400
You'll know once you see it.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.640
Heng.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.640
Heng.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.190
Wake up!

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.710
Wake up.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.280
Wake up!

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.250
Such disgrace.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.030
Lord Wang,

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.080
you're in such high spirits
during the mourning period.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.800
This is a setup.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.470
Duke, Lord Shi,

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.030
please judge with clear sight.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:18.880
Milord.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.840
Yesterday, Lord Wang saved me

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.640
and escorted my sister and me home.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.160
He is our savior.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.440
Last night,

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.750
Lord Wang suddenly came

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.020
and said we should ride
and drink together.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.030
Out of courtesy,

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.010
my sister and I agreed.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.030
But unexpectedly,

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.730
something was slipped into our drinks.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.630
When I woke up,

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.560
we were already inside the carriage.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.470
Wang Heng, how dare you

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.470
tarnish the Duke of Changyi's name
during mourning

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.750
by committing such shameless acts!

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.840
Both witnesses and evidence are here.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.010
What else do you have to say?

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.020
Using indecent means
to bring someone down

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.870
has always been the most efficient way.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.960
Words are useless now.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.080
I have been framed.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.920
Humph.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.570
Take care of these two ladies.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.890
Once the truth is uncovered,

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.000
they will be given justice.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.960
- Guards.
- Yes.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.800
Wait.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.290
He works for me.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.260
What right do you have to interfere?

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:11.790
Sorry.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.360
Lord Shi, you uphold the law
with strict fairness.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.750
You have my respect.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.930
But rest assured.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.950
If one of us commits

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.870
such disgraceful conduct,

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.380
we won't let it go unpunished.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.190
By law, he should be detained
and questioned at once.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:28.830
Guards!

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.680
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.560
Take Wang Heng away.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.830
Lord Gong.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.750
You two should head back first.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.840
Yes.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.270
Lord Gong,

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.720
I said I would handle this myself.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.170
Why did you lock him up again?

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.910
Duke,

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.090
the officials from Chang'an are here.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.630
Every word and action of yours
is under their watch.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.140
About what happened to Lord Wang today,

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.160
they caught him red-handed.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.400
If you insist on shielding him,

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.840
how will the officials see it?

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.840
They will surely think
you are bending the law for him.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.720
But Wang Heng must have been wronged.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.870
I know that.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.720
Lord Wang would never do such a thing.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.480
Right now,
the priority is to find evidence,

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.240
so we can help Lord Wang clear his name.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.050
Also,

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.640
to keep Lord Wang in custody,

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.000
our men are more reassuring

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.430
than those from Chang'an, right?

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.040
That being said,

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.190
as long as Heng's name isn't cleared,

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.390
I won't go anywhere.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.160
Don't be reckless.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.460
This isn't recklessness.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.830
It's loyalty.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.870
How could I abandon a friend in need?

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.600
You must not act rashly.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.140
Countless eyes are watching.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.310
I know.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.260
I'll move quietly.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.130
I won't alert the enemy.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.420
Hey, Senior.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.200
Senior, where are you going?

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.200
Who is there?

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.680
Yes.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.270
Duke.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.270
Open the door.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.240
You may all leave.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.190
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:56.840
Have you suffered?

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:58.560
Thanks to Lord Gong,

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.200
he had our own men watching over me,

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.840
so I wasn't harmed.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.520
Oh, right.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.220
Last night,

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.030
what exactly did you do?

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:24.660
(Wine)

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.120
Then I blacked out.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.600
You know what happened when I woke up.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:55.430
It was this place.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.040
Tavern at the East Market in the city.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:00.610
What kind of evidence

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:01.920
is this?

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.930
It's the only thing
that can prove my innocence.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.720
It can help us find Shan.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:08.160
Bring me

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.000
the bamboo slips from the last exam.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:12.160
Bamboo slips?

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.000
Yeah.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.040
Who are you?

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.150
Stay back.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.630
What do you want?

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:35.670
I received an order.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:36.990
My apologies.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.080
Stop right there.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.480
You're walking right into my hands.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.840
You alone

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:02.410
may not win against me.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:27.840
Can handwriting really be recognized?

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:29.880
If the writing material is different,

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.270
the pressure of the brushstroke
can also differ.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.960
Bamboo slips are smooth and even.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.390
But they're narrow and slender.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.840
The characters tend to be slimmer.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:39.140
Wooden tablets and silk strips

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:40.040
have a rougher surface.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:42.520
When writing on them,
to keep the ink flowing smoothly,

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.630
you'd need to press harder.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.160
The brush tip would also feel sharper.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:45.870
However,

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.040
the writer's overall style
remains the same.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.360
What habits does he have?

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.030
His strokes are steady and weighty,

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:55.000
yet the structure of his characters
is on the thin side.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:56.640
When starting a horizontal line,

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.420
the stroke tends
to lift upward slightly.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.010
When making a rightward pressing stroke,

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:03.870
it rises a little as well.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:12.860
Heng.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.560
Come a bit closer.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:20.800
That's him.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.380
(Tavern at the East Market in the city)

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:32.040
Chen really shouldn't have done this.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.730
Do you think Heng
might have made a mistake?

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.510
Isn't this handwriting comparison
far too sloppy?

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.120
It's indeed hardly convincing.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:47.630
Senior.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:51.760
- Guards!
- Keep it quiet.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:53.510
Help me out first.

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:05.670
Senior.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:07.510
Where did you rescue her from?

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.400
From the hands of the one
who killed my master.

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:13.130
You might have seen him before.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.030
What's his background?

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.600
Didn't Wang Heng tell you?

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:17.240
He's with the court.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.240
Other than me,

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.550
there must be other spies around you.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:26.890
Is it

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.660
really Chen Bushi?

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:32.390
She only has a few scrapes.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.900
She might also have been frightened.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:34.840
Nothing serious for now.

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:37.230
Duke.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.850
We brought you some Lubing.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:39.790
Join us for a bite.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:42.910
If it truly is Chen,

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:44.670
I have a way to test him.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.790
I'm just not sure if it's proper.

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:55.270
I asked you here today

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.560
because there's something to tell you.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:01.400
What is it?

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.230
It concerns Lord Wang's wrongful case.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.260
Those two women we met today...

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.130
What about them?

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.010
They were attacked by an assassin.

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:18.470
Did they die?

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:21.220
Thankfully,

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:22.570
they were saved.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Is that so?

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:26.000
However,

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.600
her wounds were too severe,

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.800
and she fainted.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:34.890
But before she lost consciousness,

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:36.480
she managed to say one thing.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:38.840
What did she say?

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:40.230
She said

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.600
that the one who framed Lord Wang

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:47.640
is hidden among us.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:49.790
No way.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.120
Among us?

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.080
I trust

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:57.630
the three of you the most.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:01.440
Your job is to take turns
protecting her.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.240
When she wakes up,

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:05.240
I'll question her myself.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.260
You can count on us, Qi.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:15.940
(Lodge)

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:26.600
Chen Bushi.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.200
Stop.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:32.240
What's wrong?

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.030
Why are you here so early?

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.840
Oh, I couldn't sleep,
so I might as well do something.

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:39.070
You should get some rest early.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:44.190
You're the thoughtful one.

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:45.590
I'll bring you Lubing tomorrow.

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:46.310
Alright.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.210
Keep a good watch.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.110
Go on.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.280

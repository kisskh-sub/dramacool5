00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:57.208
Wan Ning, the top courtesan of Liuxiang Pavilion

00:00:57.541 --> 00:00:58.333
Yunjin

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.708
A lowly female servant

00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:02.041
You two

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.041
Confess truthfully

00:01:05.125 --> 00:01:07.125
If Your Honor truly can't figure it out

00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:09.083
Perhaps recall carefully

00:01:09.375 --> 00:01:12.666
What happened when you burst into the room that day

00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:17.458
This guest bid three thousand taels for Wan Ning

00:01:17.583 --> 00:01:19.375
So I had Wan Ning serve him

00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:22.208
But who could have expected this

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.291
The corpse in the room was just a diversion tactic

00:01:27.583 --> 00:01:29.458
It was meant to draw our attention

00:01:29.916 --> 00:01:31.375
Things were chaotic then

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:32.916
There was one more servant girl

00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:34.500
No one would notice at all

00:01:34.583 --> 00:01:35.625
After that

00:01:36.083 --> 00:01:38.541
You two took turns pretending to be Yunjin

00:01:38.708 --> 00:01:40.375
When one was Yunjin

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:43.958
The other became the murderous female ghost

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:50.541
I can't figure out your relationship

00:01:50.625 --> 00:01:51.708
Why did you do this

00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:54.041
And where did the corpse come from

00:01:59.416 --> 00:02:00.958
We are real sisters

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:03.666
A lot of silver

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.166
Made all the ladies jealous and ruthless

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.916
If I didn't strike first

00:02:08.083 --> 00:02:10.416
Should I wait for them to kill me first

00:02:11.291 --> 00:02:13.458
Chunxiang, Qiulan, Xiahe

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.916
They all wanted to harm my sister

00:02:15.041 --> 00:02:16.375
Fighting for her position

00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:19.333
We saw through their evil intentions long ago

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.291
So we struck first to gain advantage

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:22.416
Hurry up

00:02:25.458 --> 00:02:27.541
So you killed Xun Wan too

00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:31.000
Xun Wan

00:02:31.583 --> 00:02:33.166
He deserved to die

00:02:39.375 --> 00:02:41.166
I'll step out for some air

00:02:48.375 --> 00:02:50.458
Your Honor Li, what's wrong

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:56.666
Wan Ning and Yunjin are both weak women

00:02:57.125 --> 00:02:58.833
If they really killed someone on the spot

00:02:59.166 --> 00:03:01.416
They couldn't keep up the disguise anymore

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.250
That's right

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:06.666
Your Honor Li, do you still have doubts

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.833
Your Honor Li

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.166
Your Honor Li, we've found them

00:03:10.208 --> 00:03:13.541
Chunxiang and Qiulan are still alive

00:03:15.416 --> 00:03:17.791
Oh, my poor daughter

00:03:17.833 --> 00:03:20.541
Those two wretches hid her in the woodshed

00:03:20.666 --> 00:03:22.708
She almost died

00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:25.166
She's alive

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.208
Then who are those two corpses

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:30.791
Probably girls who were killed before

00:03:30.916 --> 00:03:32.916
The madam surely knows better than us

00:03:34.875 --> 00:03:37.791
Why did Yunjin become like that before

00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:39.375
She ran into your room

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.791
That wretch was ugly

00:03:42.916 --> 00:03:45.666
She could never match Wan Ning's beauty

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.833
So she had wicked thoughts

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.208
I secretly kept some fine cosmetics and jewelry

00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:54.625
They're worth a lot of silver

00:03:54.833 --> 00:03:57.791
I only let the most favored girls use them

00:03:57.916 --> 00:04:00.083
She must have tried to steal them

00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:01.375
Enough, enough

00:04:01.458 --> 00:04:03.208
At least we've caught the ghost

00:04:03.333 --> 00:04:04.458
What do we do next

00:04:04.583 --> 00:04:05.916
Take them back to the Cold Case Bureau

00:04:06.208 --> 00:04:07.500
Continue questioning for details

00:04:08.416 --> 00:04:09.375
As for you

00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:11.708
You're coming with me too

00:04:36.416 --> 00:04:38.000
My Sanqing bell is missing

00:04:39.375 --> 00:04:42.083
Lin Xiaoran, don't play any tricks

00:04:42.291 --> 00:04:43.125
What tricks would I play

00:04:43.166 --> 00:04:44.833
My Sanqing bell is my livelihood

00:04:44.916 --> 00:04:46.833
I must've left it at Liuxiang Pavilion

00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.541
Don't let the madam hide it from me

00:04:49.083 --> 00:04:51.416
You even lose your con artist tools

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:54.458
Your Honor Li, I'll go back with him

00:04:54.541 --> 00:04:55.541
He helps you solve the case

00:04:55.583 --> 00:04:56.625
You help him pay me back

00:04:56.666 --> 00:04:57.583
So don't worry

00:04:57.583 --> 00:04:58.791
I'll keep an eye on him for you

00:05:03.333 --> 00:05:05.833
You two behave yourselves

00:05:18.375 --> 00:05:21.333
What kind of people do you think they are

00:05:26.791 --> 00:05:28.916
Help me, help me

00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.333
How can I help you

00:05:30.666 --> 00:05:33.000
Kill me, kill me

00:05:42.583 --> 00:05:44.250
A group of miserable people

00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:51.791
Looks like we're still too late

00:05:53.166 --> 00:05:54.708
Why hide it from Li Jingnian

00:05:55.166 --> 00:05:56.708
That guy's a stubborn fool

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.958
He only sees right and wrong, not human nature

00:06:01.208 --> 00:06:02.125
Are you alright

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.583
What happened

00:06:06.708 --> 00:06:07.416
Ghost

00:06:07.833 --> 00:06:08.958
Ghost courtesan

00:06:12.583 --> 00:06:13.208
Let's go

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:16.166
Trying to kill us.

00:06:16.208 --> 00:06:19.833
You women exist just to entertain men like me.

00:06:19.875 --> 00:06:21.875
I faked my death to lay low.

00:06:21.916 --> 00:06:23.333
Paid a fortune to come here.

00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:26.958
Didn't expect to meet a shady ghost courtesan like me.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.000
Tonight, I'll see what a ghost courtesan is like.

00:06:31.666 --> 00:06:32.833
Let's do this together.

00:06:34.708 --> 00:06:35.708
Stop!

00:06:37.791 --> 00:06:40.000
If you don't want to die again, get out now!

00:06:40.416 --> 00:06:42.291
You're the one looking for trouble.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.458
Are you alright?

00:07:05.791 --> 00:07:06.958
Why aren't you leaving?

00:07:07.791 --> 00:07:09.458
What do you think?

00:07:24.125 --> 00:07:27.708
So you suspected this case wasn't simple all along.

00:07:28.833 --> 00:07:32.208
Didn't you notice the madam wasn't surprised by the bodies?

00:07:32.583 --> 00:07:33.666
And those courtesans too.

00:07:33.833 --> 00:07:35.375
They're all lying nonstop.

00:07:35.375 --> 00:07:36.333
Blaming each other.

00:07:36.416 --> 00:07:37.833
Deliberately disrupting our investigation.

00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:40.000
I remember you told me,

00:07:40.416 --> 00:07:43.916
you saw Chunxiang and Qiulan hiding scars on their necks.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:54.125
So there’s more than one female ghost in Liuxiang Pavilion.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.208
I suspect all of them are.

00:08:01.666 --> 00:08:02.583
Lin Xiaoran.

00:08:23.583 --> 00:08:25.458
I've already given you all my cosmetics.

00:08:25.541 --> 00:08:27.333
Please let me go.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.291
I never wanted to hurt you.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:31.333
You say you didn't want to hurt us?

00:08:32.333 --> 00:08:34.125
Wretch, get out of my way!

00:08:34.291 --> 00:08:35.791
Let me tell you,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
I'm not the real owner of Liuxiang Pavilion.

00:08:39.083 --> 00:08:41.708
You can't afford to cross the one behind me.

00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.250
Where's the antidote? The real antidote?

00:08:45.375 --> 00:08:46.375
Antidote?

00:08:46.708 --> 00:08:50.083
You don't really think the gu poison I gave you

00:08:50.166 --> 00:08:51.625
actually has an antidote, do you?

00:08:52.541 --> 00:08:54.583
Get out! All of you, get out!

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.500
Move! Leave!

00:09:05.166 --> 00:09:06.125
Sister!

00:09:12.125 --> 00:09:13.125
Sister!

00:09:13.875 --> 00:09:18.041
We almost managed to escape.

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:19.958
Just a little more...

00:09:21.375 --> 00:09:23.041
Luoyang Captain Wang Bin.

00:09:26.458 --> 00:09:28.291
Executed for corruption a year ago.

00:09:28.916 --> 00:09:31.333
Didn't expect to see him here too.

00:09:32.708 --> 00:09:36.291
His death looks just like Xun Wan's.

00:09:37.375 --> 00:09:39.666
He was likely trapped in a deep hallucination.

00:09:39.708 --> 00:09:41.291
Looks like you were right.

00:09:41.541 --> 00:09:43.583
All the guests here are shady types.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.500
And they're all closely tied to the madam.

00:09:49.708 --> 00:09:51.333
What do you all know?

00:09:51.583 --> 00:09:52.500
Don't hide anything from me.

00:10:00.125 --> 00:10:02.375
The Sanqing Bell wouldn't ring for no reason.

00:10:02.708 --> 00:10:05.375
The gu insects inside are especially sensitive to their own kind.

00:10:06.666 --> 00:10:08.541
What does this have to do with gu insects?

00:10:09.125 --> 00:10:10.333
Hey, where are you going?

00:10:10.416 --> 00:10:11.583
To talk to the madam.

00:10:30.083 --> 00:10:31.083
She's not breathing.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.625
Where is she?

00:10:36.291 --> 00:10:37.666
It can't be this fast.

00:10:38.333 --> 00:10:39.458
Look for clues.

00:10:46.833 --> 00:10:48.083
There's a door here.

=Voyage to Haihun, Season 1=

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.260
=Episode 13=

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:46.730
Why does your blade look

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.120
exactly the same as mine?

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.330
They were forged as a pair.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.410
Weapons passed down from my sect.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.360
Your name is De Jiu?

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.210
And your master is Yun Qing,
the Swift Blade?

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.920
Though we are wandering heroes,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.520
our skills often go unused.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.610
At most, we smooth over disputes

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.520
just to make a living.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.700
Your master was a man of burning passion

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.860
and determined to clear the name
of wandering heroes.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.310
So, he took on tasks for the court.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.400
Over time,
he stopped returning to the village.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.060
Though Master raised me from childhood,

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.420
I never truly understood him.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.000
But his letters and his heart

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:37.880
were mostly filled with you.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.270
Then, in your eyes,

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:43.960
what kind of man was he?

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.850
Stern and seldom smiling,

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:50.910
unusually strict.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.200
Every word he spoke carried reason.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:57.910
When I slacked off,

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.960
he never scolded me.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.360
But no matter how well I did,

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.560
he never once praised me.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.030
You were always in his heart.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.910
In his view,

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.340
you were not his disciple anymore.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.460
You were his daughter.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.040
He was a close friend
of your birth father.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.940
That day, he heard your family
was in danger.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.530
But by the time he arrived,
it was too late.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.590
Just as the villains
were about to harm you,

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.330
he fought with all he had
to keep you safe.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.630
Though badly wounded,

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.560
seeing you unharmed

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.000
and crying in his arms,

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.570
he felt it was all worth it.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.430
From that day on,

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.950
he took any job that could earn money.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.530
No matter how dangerous,

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.630
all he wanted was to give you
a better life.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.560
So, he became a spy for the court,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.360
even if it meant danger, toil,

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.600
and disdain.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.540
Firstly,
it was to atone for your parents.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.890
Secondly, for you, he had no regrets.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.720
Master once said

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.920
that once a person holds onto a wish,

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.930
the blade will lose its sharpness.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:55.670
You are

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:56.950
what he's been holding onto.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.360
Uncle, your blade's aura

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.880
made me feel the warmth
of someone I once knew.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.660
But I will never

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.320
see him again.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.740
(Wucheng Village)

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.870
- Duke.
- Can you two vanish?

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.070
Lord Li Han has ordered

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.220
that we ensure your safety.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.220
Duke,

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.710
the closer we get to Chang'an,
the more cautious we must be.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.430
Can you two lend a hand?

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.430
Carry those things back.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.940
Quickly, quickly.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.920
Careful now.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:58.680
Put some strength into it.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.120
Mr. and Mrs. Kang have arrived.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.560
Please serve the tea.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:04.760
Mr. Kang.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.430
My apologies.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.660
The venue is booked for today.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.120
Don't stop them.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.060
Let them come through.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.490
The more people, the livelier.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.720
I am Kang Ning.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.680
Nice to meet you.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.920
I am Qi Chang.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.580
- Please.
- Please.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.430
Your lady's grace feels familiar.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.690
Have we met in Changyi?

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.000
You're from Changyi as well?

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.960
Yes.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.830
Last time,
I returned to visit my family.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.000
I saw the equine administration
thriving in Changyi.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.670
So, I joined in.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.480
So, you are Xu Pingjun,

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.510
who broke the wood?

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.160
Xu Pingjun,

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:59.080
the Geng contestant.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.490
Meeting an old friend
in a foreign land is truly a blessing.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.680
I never expected Qi

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.260
to have the chance to meet my lady.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.190
That is quite the fated bond.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:09.710
- Come.
- Come.

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.480
Your attire tells me

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:22.950
you must be a wandering hero.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.720
Has this sword

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.680
ever tasted blood?

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.960
A wandering hero
may break the law by force,

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.680
but he would never take a life lightly.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.270
To abstain is to endure,

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.910
but that does not mean never to kill.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.870
There are times when one has no choice.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.430
Seems you also hold the heart
of a wandering hero.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.270
Of course.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:50.660
With the sky as my canopy,

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.870
the earth as my seat,

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.870
elegant melodies all around...

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:55.750
Kindred spirits by our side...

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:57.770
We drink and share our joy.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.710
Unbound by the ways of the world.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.120
How carefree and at ease it feels.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.510
Ha ha ha.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:06.790
- Come.
- Come.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.360
Yet,

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:16.870
fate toys with us.

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:18.440
True chivalry lies not in appearance,

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.360
but in the heart.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.160
Chivalry of the court

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.580
lies in the affairs of the realm.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.560
To bring the people a good life

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.580
is the path of chivalry.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.220
Chivalry of the common folks

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.830
lies in the care for right and wrong.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:31.920
Welding the swords

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:33.750
is for the sake

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:34.910
of justice.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:37.990
Mr. Kang.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.800
A wise insight.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.510
You're dressed so elegantly.

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:44.100
You must be a noble
headed for Chang'an.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.240
I only hope you'll bring blessings
to the people.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.080
Then the wandering heroes like us

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.720
can retire from the martial world.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.320
You jest.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.630
Whether in the court
or among the people,

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.320
our hearts are always
with the people's well-being.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.240
To bring peace to a land,

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.630
or to save just one or a few lives,

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.480
is all part of the path of chivalry.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:07.750
Today,

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.050
meeting you feels like reuniting
with an old friend.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.120
I will offer tea in place of wine.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:14.510
An honor to meet you, Qi.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.010
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.150
Who said you could peek?

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.840
Don't flatter yourself.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.080
I was merely passing by.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:51.270
But back in Hongnong,

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:52.970
you risked your life for me,

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.150
helping me clear my name.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.460
I should thank you properly.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:57.350
Thanks.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.360
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.440
It just seemed suspicious,

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.570
so I happened to dig
into Li Wei's affair.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.070
Your blade technique is impressive.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.040
Can you teach me a few moves
for self-defense?

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.200
Sure.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.270
Let's see what you can do first.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:27.160
Are you a monkey? All you do is run.

I can't beat you,

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:30.080
so I have to run.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.740
Still, you've got some good moves.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.630
Want to learn? I can teach you.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:36.630
This is called parkour.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.900
If you follow my method

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:41.750
and build up
your core strength training,

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:43.690
you can pick up parkour quickly.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:49.840
What is it?

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.390

I heard from my master

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.440
that once a person harbors a thought,

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:02.390
feelings soon follow.

I'll teach you the rapid mastery method

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:16.090
of parkour as you eat.

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:19.230
Parkour

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:22.910
is not just about the burst
of strength when climbing,

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.910
but the release of force on landing.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.870
That's how you protect yourself.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:29.840
Just look at you.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.160
Moving stiffly up and down.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.840
Your body rides on sheer momentum.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:35.440

I could never be like you.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.010
When I was little,
my parents didn't care for me.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.250
It was my grandmother who raised me.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.860
She kept a close watch on me.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.070
And I kept wanting to run away.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.080
But every time, she dragged me back.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.410
Scolding and punishment
always followed.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.240
So I told myself:

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:06.020
I must grow up quickly

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.520
and leave her.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.870
Later on,

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:12.050
Grandmother passed away.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.400
It was then that I realized

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:16.910
just how much I couldn't bear
to part with her.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.320
Someone told me

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:21.120
that I mustn't cry.

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:23.770
If I shed tears,

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.290
Grandmother wouldn't leave in peace.

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:28.670
So, I held it in,

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.200
refusing to cry.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.080
One day, I couldn't hold it back anymore

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:33.930
and cried so hard.

treated her to a pastry

and

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.080
chatted a bit about life with her.

why would she risk her own safety
for you?

Back in Hongnong,
when you were falsely accused,

my senior
helped you investigate at once.

Could it be there's some spark
between you two?

No, absolutely not.

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:37.600
Let me make this clear.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.440
She is my senior.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.130
Any matters of her feelings
go through me first.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.460

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:48.560
show some stance?

If your senior and I end up together,

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:59.320
shouldn't you show some courtesy
to your future brother-in-law?

You must watch your words and actions.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:52.320
Don't stir up trouble again.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:53.600
Rest assured, Lord Gong.

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:55.060

There's a lord who wishes to meet you.

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:25.350
Who might that be?

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:26.970
You'll know when you get there.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.390
This way, Lord Wang.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.940

I didn't expect you
to still have such refined taste.

In old age, sleep comes lightly.

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:06.830
I'm just fishing

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:09.240
for a bit of pleasure.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.070
It seems you've had

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.670
quite the haul from night fishing today.

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:19.120

=Episode 8=

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.710
Don't move! Release the Duke!

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.550
Hold still.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.760
San.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.990
Even if you're not San,

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.920
don't act rashly.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.000
We'll do our best to meet your demands.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.840
Who is San?

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:43.790
He's got the wrong person.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.710
Lady De Jiu.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.660
Why are you doing this?

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.150
Yeah, Senior.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.590
- Quiet.
- Watch yourself.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.790
We take him down first.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.760
Then we fight our way out.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.600
Don't be rash.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.040
Our life comes first.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.510
We need a few fast horses.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.840
You must let us leave without harm.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.690
Alright, fine.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.560
We have many horses.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.070
I'll pick you the fastest ones.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.560
But we need some time

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.960
to choose the horses.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.120
Miss, don't act on impulse.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.080
Senior.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.440
Silence.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.400
Everyone.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.120
We came here only to find a way to live.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.910
We're not here to take lives.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.430
But if forced into a corner,

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.750
we'll fight to the bitter end.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.310
It's no good for anyone.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.360
Alright, alright. Hurry up.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.800
Bring out our finest horses.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.910
Move quickly, also,

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.680
no one is to act without orders.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:31.710
Yes.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:39.750
Hyah!

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.310
Hyah!

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.910
Hyah, hyah!

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.890
Hyah!

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.270
Hyah, hyah!

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:48.800
Hyah!

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.360
Lady De Jiu,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.240
spare your hand.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.520
Hyah!

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.750
Get off.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:57.710
Uh?

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.240
Duke.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.360
Duke, are you alright?

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.200
Duke.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.870
I'm fine.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.430
What brings you here?

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.710
You were in danger.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.080
But I can't let you take the risk.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.430
This can't happen again.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.870
Again?

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.590
As if such a thing should happen twice.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.470
Come on.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.400
Hyah!

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.310
Hyah!

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:22.750
Whoa.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.870
Are you alright?

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:28.680
Lady Qingge.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.680
You mustn't act so recklessly again.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.130
You vanished in a second.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.990
What if something happened to you?

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.870
I only thought I'd be faster on a horse.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.350
From now on, treat your Qingge well.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.360
Understood?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.900
Lord Wang.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.590
Protect the Duke;
I'll keep chasing. Hyah!

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.840
Go on, quickly!

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.640
Do you need a hand?

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.310
Hyah!

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.520
Hyah!

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:58.550
Leave it to me.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.030
You go first.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.280
I'll hold them off.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.960
Go!

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:06.470
Hyah!

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:07.840
Hyah!

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.620
(Huo)

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.140
(Li Han, Imperial Guard Commander)

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.270
We both serve the Imperial Court.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.000
My mission is secret.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.310
The Duke must not be alarmed.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.800
Nor may I tell you, Lord Li.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.920
I ask that you keep this confidential.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.440
Understood.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.760
Let's go.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.880
Hyah!

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.840
Yun Qing.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.270
Looks like our feud

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.800
should end here today.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.000
Just you alone?

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.320
Hmph.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.270
Master.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.080
De Jiu.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.510
Jiu, be careful.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.270
I'll count to three.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:09.730
Then we rush out together.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.120
One.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:14.240
Two.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.560
Three!

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.680
Master!

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.240
Go!

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.630
Go!

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.670
Go!

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.430
Hyah!

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.320
Hyah!

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:30.550
Giddy-up!

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.400
In that direction.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:34.350
Whoa.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.880
De Jiu.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:44.880
Save her.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.240
De Jiu slipped into the Duke's mansion,

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.240
harboring ill intent.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.410
And this time,

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.920
she even seized the Duke.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.160
Such a crime deserves execution.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:02.240
Duke, don't let judgment be clouded.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.750
If I take advantage of her now,

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.920
wouldn't word of it bring me shame?

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:08.430
Wait until she recovers

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.510
before passing judgment.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.630
Nonsense.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.360
How is she?

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.720
It's only superficial wounds.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:22.360
But the cuts are quite deep.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.510
She's lost consciousness.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.560
Duke.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.390
Found the physician?

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:30.870
I sent someone, but no word yet.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.200
We can't wait.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:34.510
Stop the bleeding, disinfect,

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:36.630
stitch it up, bandage, that should work.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:37.470
Let me do it.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.120
Heng, this is no small matter.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.200
Can't worry about that now.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.870
Send someone to gather some supplies.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.600
I need garlic,

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.600
- Atractylodes, linen cloth,
- Linen cloth.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.440
and also…

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.080
a still for brewing wine.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.360
The brewing still…

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.410
Still?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:58.720
Add more firewood.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.830
Sterilize it with high heat.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.680
Alright.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:07.910
Fan it slower.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:09.180
Keep it at this temperature.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.160
Don't worry.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.040
Bushi can do it.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:12.280
Trust me.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:13.200
I'll leave it to you.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.320
Heng, everything is ready.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.510
I've even peeled garlic for you.

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:20.370
But we're treating wounds,

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:21.270
not cooking a meal.

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:22.560
What is garlic for?

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.240
Garlic produces allicin.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.270
Before antibiotics were invented,

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:27.680
it was the best anti-inflammatory.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.380
What are you talking about?

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.630
It's...

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:31.600
wound medicine.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.200
Now that makes sense, doesn't it?

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.000
Lord Shi,

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:38.670
regarding reducing personnel,

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.800
we'll report it to the Duke right away.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.080
Then I'll trouble you two, my lords.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.120
Reducing personnel?

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:55.910
Time is running short.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:56.750
This matter

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.750
can't be put off for too long.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.080
Mm.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.270
Duke, Lord Gong is here to see you.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:08.230
What's this about?

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:09.690
I don't know.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.350
Go on then.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:13.360
Mm, let's go.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.080
Qingge.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.670
When you examined Lady De Jiu's wound,

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.630
did you see three red moles
on her left shoulder?

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:32.750
No.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:35.150
Think carefully.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:36.110
Are you sure?

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:37.910
Mm, I'm sure.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:40.930
What is it, Wang?

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:41.790
It's nothing.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.960
(She's not San.)

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.080
(Can two people look exactly the same?)

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:19.350
Lady De Jiu,

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:20.440
I know you have your reasons.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:21.840
Just stay here.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.800
We won't harm you.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:25.750
It's not your concern.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.040
Lady De Jiu,

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:29.790
if you leave that wound untreated,

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.510
your clothes will fuse with the flesh.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:34.320
And by then,

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.960
you'll never be able to take them off.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.480
That's right, Lady De Jiu.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.550
Wang prepared some medicine for you.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.000
He's about to stitch up your injury.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.720
But don't worry,

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.960
I'll be right here with you

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:50.800
and keep you covered.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.240
- You...
- Yes?

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.870
move along, no peeking.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.030
Relax, I won't.

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:02.230
Come here.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.390
There's no anesthetic.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.190
I'll be as gentle as I can.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.130
Guys, we've traveled for so long.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.790
Who would truly want to return?

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.290
Duke.

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:38.360
Order is kept through propriety.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.600
Now you are about to enter the capital.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.960
I fear we have no choice but to

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.870
obey this imperial edict from Chang'an.

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:48.390
You decide.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:49.800
Lord Gong.

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:51.350
Very well.

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:56.470
Lord Gong.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.720
Please look at these ministers.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.400
Their years are advanced.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.390
Why not let them
spend their years in Changyi?

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.780
The House of Wang has served
two generations of Dukes.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.150
Their merits are great.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.630
If we send them back to Changyi,

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:13.030
it will chill everyone's hearts.

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:16.120
Better to pick a few with lower ranks,

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:18.750
so no one will have objections.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.680
Their titles may be small,

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:22.760
but they handle all daily affairs.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:23.920
No, that won't do.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.150
In my view,

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:30.660
(List of attendants: Li Qi, Du Ruofeng,
Chen Bushi, Zhang Sheng)

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:32.440
Let's settle on these few.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:33.990
Alright.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:35.630
They hardly learned any craft

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:37.630
and not fit for major duties.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:38.960
So we send them back.

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.480
Lord Gong's words make sense.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:42.840
No, absolutely not.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.480
These are brothers I've grown up with.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.030
How could I leave them behind?

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.270
I ask you, my lord, to decide.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.670
Chancellor, don't be anxious.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:55.910
Choosing the right people
affects many parties.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.240
We should plan carefully.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:00.960
Plan for what?

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.550
Everyone goes. That's it.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.720
Wait, wait, wait...

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:17.390
Wang.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.130
Lady De Jiu's fever has gone down.

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:20.320
Two hundred.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.200
Alright.

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:23.440
Wang.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.720
What is this unusual martial arts move?

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:28.520
This place is far too dangerous.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:30.440
I need to enhance my physical training

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:31.750
to stay alive.

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:34.390
Lord Wang.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.550
I have something

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:39.320
to discuss with you.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.180
Ah?

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.080
We haven't arrived yet

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.550
and they're limiting our numbers.

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:43.440
This talk of ritual

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.790
might just be an excuse.

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.430
Right now, the biggest headache is

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.550
how we decide on the personnel.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:52.000
I truly can't bring myself to say it.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.630
Lord Gong, are you implying

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:55.320
we must abide by the Imperial Edict,

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.870
yet still win everyone's acceptance?

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:00.440
Most importantly, the Duke must approve.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:03.360
Please, Lord Wang, share your guidance

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.720
and help light the way.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.910
Let us work together to choose wisely.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.200
That's easy.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.300
(I recall that 200 officials
died in Chang'an.)

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:24.030
(If more names can be cut,)

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:25.110
(we can save them)

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.120
(and perhaps even change the history.)

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.560
Lord Wang.

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:31.110
Oh.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.160
Let me think.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.440
I have a plan.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.840
We set an exam to select them

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:38.390
with questions scored by points.

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:39.390
Papers graded anonymously.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:40.450
Whoever gets certain scores

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:41.550
will head to Chang'an.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:43.960
That's an excellent idea.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.030
I didn't come up with it alone.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.320
Back in my hometown,

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:49.440
this is how the state selects talent.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.560
Eh?

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:51.480
Come to think of it,

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.270
this tradition began in this land.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:55.350
Oh?

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.000
Why have I never heard of it?

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.360
The time hasn't come yet.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.720
Lord Gong, let me remind you,

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:03.790
once we truly enter Chang'an,

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.360
things will be tangled and complex.

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:08.360
We'll need capable allies to assist us.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:11.080
Lord Wang, you speak the absolute truth.

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:13.890
To select the best for the court,

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.080
the examination topic

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.200
must be ingenious

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:17.150
and truly unique.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:18.390
No room for carelessness.

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:19.390
Not the slightest.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:20.230
Exactly.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.120
I'll head to bed first.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.360
Alright, I won't disturb you.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.080
Rest early, I won't intrude.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:46.900
(Longshan Inn)

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:47.790
Leaving so soon?

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:52.340
If it weren't for my morning exercise,

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:53.480
you would've run away.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.150
Do you even know who took the Qilin?

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.030
In the end, it's all about the Qilin.

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.990
That's right.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.270
I want the Qilin.

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:08.280
It helps you to find your master's killer.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.720
I suppose

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.360
you want to avenge your master.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.880
But how will you do that?

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:19.830
Why not stay and heal first?

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.000
Then plan carefully.

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.950
We have given

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.640
your master a proper burial.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.680
Want to visit his grave?

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:35.960
They serve the Court.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:37.350
You can't do much.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.400
I may not be able to help much,

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.350
but we'll go to Chang'an.

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.910
I bet that's where you're headed too.

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:49.120
We can at least share meals

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.080
on the way.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:52.760
What do you say?

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:53.680
Think it over.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.480
I appreciate your kindness.

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:01.720
I'll repay your help another day.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:03.960
I shouldn't trouble you.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.480
See you.

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:14.550
(If only I'd cared more for San back then.)

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.590
(I wouldn't feel so heavy now)

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:19.200

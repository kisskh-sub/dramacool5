00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.150
With wine in hand,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.070
I'm free,

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.480
unbound, and at ease.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.310
What are you doing?

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.600
Making your wish come true.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.550
Quick, recite the spell.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.520
Go on, say it.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.000
You cast the spell.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.640
Why should I recite it?

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.920
Don't tell me you…

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.560
forgot the incantation already.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.480
You make the wish.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.150
Of course you recite the spell.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.760
Hurry up.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.960
Alright.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.710
Unlock the mystical.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.200
Unlock the mystical.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.740
Bridge the ancient and the present.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.280
Bridge the Ancient and the Present.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.870
I want it and I get it.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.200
I want it and I get it?

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:15.530
Worry about nothing.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.590
Unlock the mystical.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.120
Bridge the ancient and the present.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.890
I want it and I get it.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.640
Worry about nothing.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.800
Set.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.960
This is...

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.870
The wish worked.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.470
You're not just being my friend

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.120
because I'm Liu He, are you?

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.150
Between buddies,

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.170
we don't fuss over nonsense.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.160
Buddies?

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.470
What does that mean?

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.990
It means

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.520
true friend.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.200
Alright.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.030
Then I, Liu He,

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.590
will call you my buddy.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.900
Honestly, I'd rather

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.150
you were Qi Chang.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.680
Both are me.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.960
Wang Heng.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.840
Oh dear.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:23.730
My apologies.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.560
I drank too much alone last night

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.600
and lost track of time.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.730
That Blank Seal I gave you...

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.000
Did you bring it along?

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.870
How could I leave behind the finest jade?

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.400
Listen,

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.330
you only need to think of one thing.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.190
What is it?

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.910
Just think about

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.030
what official title
to be carved on that seal.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.560
We're heading to Chang'an
to make our mark.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.030
I'm grateful to you.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.870
Come on.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.280
Get ready to depart.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.400
- Alright.
- Okay.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.320
Let's move out.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:11.340
(Changyi)

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.600
Hyah! Hyah!

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:27.750
Whoa! Make way!

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.040
Watch out, don't get run over!

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.560
Duke, please slow down.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.160
Duke, wait for us.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.220
- Duke!
- Keep up back there!

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.030
Hyah!

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.840
Hyah!

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.440
Hyah!

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.560
Hyah!

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.920
Duke.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.280
The journey to Chang'an is long

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.830
and the matter is of great importance.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.510
We must not rush or lose proper decorum.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.050
And we mustn't act recklessly.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.920
Lord Gong, I haven't traveled this far.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.260
Please understand me.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:00.790
Hyah!

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.360
Well well.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.480
Lord Wang, what worries you

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.850
is what troubles me as well.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:09.710
Uh?

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.000
Oh.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.780
The trip to Chang'an will be full of danger.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.460
I must trouble you to stay vigilant.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.630
I must trouble you instead.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.240
I'm already an old man.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.200
The Duke refuses to heed my advice.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.880
We may not have reached Chang'an yet,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.450
but the trial has already begun.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:28.430
Yes, yes.

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.470
Every word and action of the Duke

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.390
is under the watchful eyes of others.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.280
Right, right.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.430
A single careless move

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.830
and tongues will wag.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.710
The Duke's path
to the throne will be hard.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.040
You are not only his subject,

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.430
but also his friend.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.360
Yes, yes.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:48.640
Heng,

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:49.520
come feel the breeze.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.350
Giddy-up.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.750
Giddy-up.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.460
(Changyi)

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.980
(Dingtao, Longshan Inn)

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:26.780
(Longshan Inn)

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.820
Please, come inside.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:36.990
Will you be staying or eating?

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.030
Bring some tea.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.160
Have a seat, please.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.480
The wind howls. The moon hides.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.120
A lone crane flies south.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.120
(Li Wei, Yannian's guard)

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.800
Are the Jinlin Guards here?

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.120
A night prowler entering my home

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.000
never comes without reason.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.270
I am Li Wei of the Jinlin Guards.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.120
I've come to claim the Qilin Token.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.580
(Swift Blade, Yun Qing)

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.630
Lord Li, have you brought gold?

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:35.620
Payment upon delivery.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.600
No questions asked.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.960
It's the code of the martial world.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.340
Surely the Court won't break its word?

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.600
You misunderstand.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:49.130
This is no ordinary item.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.000
We need to verify everything first.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.640
Once confirmed, we'll present the gold.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.000
Since the Court fails to honor the rules,

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.610
we'll deal with this Qilin in our way.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.540
De Jiu,

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:08.120
let's go.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.640
As for rules,

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:17.360
I doubt they're yours to decide.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:11.550
Open the door! Open up!

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.050
Is anyone there?

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.200
Hurry, open the door.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.630
Come on, faster.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.000
I hear people inside.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:20.390
Open up.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.580
Hold on, Duke.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.870
This run-down inn in the countryside...

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.120
I reckon it's been deserted.

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:27.810
The county town is not far ahead.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.500
- There will be better lodging.
- Yes.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.600
Besides, this place doesn't look safe.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.440
- Indeed.
- Mm.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.480
Mm.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:37.910
None of you...

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:39.870
want me to stay here, right?

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.330
Mm.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:42.310
I insist on staying.

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:43.280
Hey.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.860
Here we go again.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.870
Ay, Duke…

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:47.630
Your status is one of honor.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.840
Lodging and meals follow court protocol.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.980
So what if my status is high?

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.920
I don't need to sit above everyone.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.220
I can share the hardships of the people.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.500
I find this little inn quite fine.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:58.900
Unlike my mansion,

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.180
it's nothing but a grand facade.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:02.140
Inside, it's just

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:04.480
filled with your tiresome company.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.090
Ay… sir.

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:09.390
My apologies.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.830
Our humble shop is closed.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:11.850
Oh.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.760
There's a great inn not far from here.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.710
It's quite comfortable to stay there.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.360
May I trouble you to walk a bit further?

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.710
Mm.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.760
That works well.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:21.840
Yes.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.800
Then…

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.200
You all can stay there.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.280
I'll stay here instead.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:26.480
Ah, that won't do, Duke.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.670
Duke, this isn't right.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:28.720
There's no way to stop me.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:29.960
I'll stay here too.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:30.800
Alas.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.000
It's inconvenient for you to stay here.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.550
So you do know it's inconvenient.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.270
Yet you show no care
for a lady's comfort.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:37.320
Or is it that

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.030
you're trying to hide something

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.540
from us.

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:42.320
Out here in the middle of nowhere,

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.240
what could I do?

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.600
At most,

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:46.980
enjoy the fun of hunting.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:49.980
- Sir, sir.
- Can't stop him.

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.900
Duke.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.120
I'll stay here with the Duke.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:53.900
You arrange for more guards.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:58.360
Do the job. You'll be paid.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.570
Ah, understood.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.550
This place does feel a bit odd.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.770
- Then go another comfortable inn.
- Clean.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:09.630
- Alright.
- Quiet.

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:10.490
I won't.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.420
Get it tidied up.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:13.530
We were chasing a wild boar just now.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.240
But the beast's strength is astonishing.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.290
It made such a mess.

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:24.180
I ask for your lordships' understanding.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:26.090
- Wild boar?
- Mm.

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:27.160
You're already closed.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.380
Why still go after wild boar?

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.710
Haha.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.000
To be honest,

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:32.500
I'm actually a hunter by trade.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:33.630
This inn here

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.840
is merely my side business.

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:35.750
See?

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.090
Oh.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.100
It's alright.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:39.910
Just be careful.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.960
Then tonight, let's try something new.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.770
How about roast wild boar?

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.120
Good.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.440
I'll see to it at once.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.210
Seems like those folks

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.970
must be people of wealth or high rank.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.570
You'd better be smart about this.

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.620
That's Liu He, Duke of Changyi.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.800
The Qilin came from him.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:24.000
They have the advantage in numbers.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.480
We can't confront them head-on.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.150
Or we might alert them too soon.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:32.470
Stay calm.

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:34.030
The Qilin matter is top secret.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.630
It involves the Duke and us both.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:38.350
Right now,

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.000
we have to work together.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.630
First, let's get them to leave.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:45.990
Master.

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:47.630
This man can't be trusted.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:48.750
Don't worry.

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:50.910
The Qilin is still in your hands.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:52.800
As for the gold,

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:54.910
I'll settle that with you as well.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.820
What kind of cooperation do you want?

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:01.990
Know how to roast meat?

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:19.630
What's that smell?

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:21.150
Smells amazing.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:22.010
Hey, hey, hey.

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:22.870
Sir.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:23.720
Take a look.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:26.000
This is our special roast wild boar.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.550
I was about to let you have a taste.

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:29.960
Have a seat inside.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.240
Better not stain your robes.

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:32.580
Wait over there.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.720
- Hurry up, I'm starving.
- Alright.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.650
Alright, alright.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:36.820
Just a moment.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.900
Sir, the finest roast meat.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.000
Here you go, enjoy.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:48.840
Smells wonderful.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:53.920
I knew it.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.750
For true flavor, this is the place.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:57.920
Have a whiff.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.440
Go on, smell it.

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:04.390
So fragrant.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.630
Isn't this just roasted meat?

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.840
What's so special about it?

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.910
This is wild boar meat.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.080
Freshly hunted.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:15.480
What's worth eating in it?

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.630
Ah, you don't get it.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.190
It's just been hunted.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.720
It carries the unique aroma
of this land.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:27.700
That is the way of rustic delicacies.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.000
Innkeep.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:32.960
Hey.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.870
This meat is far too greasy.

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:37.360
Do you have something lighter?

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.320
We don't have those.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.580
Come on,

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:41.840
it's rare for us to come out.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.150
Why settle for simple fare?

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:46.080
The journey's been exhausting.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.360
I really can't eat much.

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:48.720
I'll head back to rest.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.280
Wang, I'll take my leave.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:53.710
Innkeep.

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:55.030
Yes, sir.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.550
Do you have any millet or beans here?

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.980
Sorry, sir, we don't have that.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.880
Come on.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:08.360
Don't eat that.

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:09.840
Fine, I will anyway.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:19.440
What are you doing?

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.320
Why are you here?

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:32.550
Look over this way.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:34.870
The Duke of Changyi is heavily guarded.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.360
You mean to kill him here?

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.360
Do you think the Court will let you go?

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:41.840
Once the Duke of Changyi is taken down,

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:43.790
those cowardly rats outside

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.600
wouldn't dare to serve.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.150
All I know is,

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.850
we are now on the same boat.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.270
If you want to get out,
don't act rashly.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.220
You've been watching us?

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.110
And you stopped us from killing the Duke.

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:00.960
Who exactly are you?

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:06.440
Why didn't you

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:08.480
say so earlier?

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:11.790
You didn't listen.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:12.910
Who could've stopped you?

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.210
Glad Qingge didn't eat it.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.750
I saw several blade marks in the lobby.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.960
That must have been

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.750
left from slaughtering a boar.

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:27.380
But the mark on the cabinet is deep and long.

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:29.270
It stretched all the way
to the signboard.

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:32.330
What kind of wild boar
could leap that high?

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.960
I also noticed several spots of blood

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.150
had been covered up.

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:39.080
The bleeding wasn't much,

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:41.030
more like traces from a fight.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:42.810
If it were just butchering a boar,

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.970
there should be more blood left.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.580
Even if the wild boar struggled,

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.060
it couldn't have splattered everywhere.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.070
This is a proper inn,

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.350
yet there's not a grain or vegetable.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:59.140
Why go out of the way
to kill a wild boar?

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:02.710
Couldn't jumping high

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.160
just be what that wild boar does?

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:06.910
Couldn't hunting

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:08.350
just be the innkeeper's pastime?

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:09.640
What do you think?

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.110
Me?

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:25.030
Come on, let's go take a look.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.640
Go, go, go.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.440
Still not giving up?

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:53.150
See?

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:54.550
Told you it was wild boar meat.

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:55.480
You didn't believe me.

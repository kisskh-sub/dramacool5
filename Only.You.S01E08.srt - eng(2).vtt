00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.040
Can you please just tell me the truth?

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.080
What happened between the two of you?

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.280
How do you even know
that double-crossing snake?

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.400
Tawan's dad and Ayla's dad

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.440
are sworn enemies, basically.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.800
Why would we let her meddle
in our company business?

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.920
I don't even know why you came back.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.000
You can't do this to me!

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.280
I won't let you leave this house

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.760
until you get over her.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.320
I won't break up with you.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.400
And you can't give up either, okay?

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.680
Hello?

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.360
Please let her rest a bit longer.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.560
She's not ready
to return to work just yet.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.760
Please, sir.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.440
The president had to reschedule so much
that she took the blame for this.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.040
Fans and reporters

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.880
have been crowding the office,
asking where she is.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.360
We're starting
to lose control of the narrative.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.680
I'm worried rumors will start flying.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.600
The reason I called you here

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.840
is because the company approached me.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.320
They want you back at work.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.560
I gave them my word you would return,

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.040
even though the termination fee

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.840
isn't that high.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.000
But I don't want to destroy your dream,

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.560
everything you've worked so hard to build.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.600
You can go back to work,

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.400
go back to living your life.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.760
But you'll be under 24-hour surveillance
by this bodyguard team.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.280
And if I hear even once

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.640
that you're still in contact with Tawan,

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.960
I'll destroy everything with my own hands.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.360
Think about it.
What do you want to hold onto?

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.440
A love with no future,

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.040
or a dream you built with your own hands?

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.960
Are you sure
this plan's going to work this time?

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.440
Last time was a flop.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.640
Don't worry, sir.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.800
The guy we've brought in this time
is sharp. He never fails.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.600
Better not be all talk.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.360
Let me see the blueprint.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.520
Careful, Mr. Thana!

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.240
A TOTAL FAMILY WIPEOUT

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.040
Where's Ayla?

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.320
She's rehearsing her songs, sir.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.480
Keep her safe.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.480
Yes, sir.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.880
Boss, we just got word. Mr. Thana
was the target of a shooting attempt.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.200
But the team caught it in time.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.880
He's safe.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.120
Any injuries?

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.800
None. Do you think…

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.480
it was just a warning shot?

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.040
According to our intel,

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.480
there's a major suburban development bid
coming up next month.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.000
Mr. Thana's company
will definitely be in the running.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.800
T.R. Develop is usually the frontrunner.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.200
Tell Ayla's security detail
to raise their alert level.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.000
If they need backup,
we're ready to step in.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.480
Got it, Boss.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.520
Have you been busy lately?

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.840
Lately? I've been prepping for my concert.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.160
Vocal practice, dance rehearsals,

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.240
song meetings…

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.520
I've also got a shoot next week.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.040
A food show.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.840
I'm dying to eat something good!

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.240
Are you okay?

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.280
You seem tense.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.120
I'm worried.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.800
Worried?

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.040
Worried

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.280
and protective.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.480
When I'm not there
to look after you myself, I get anxious.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.760
Promise me

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.120
you'll behave. No sneaking around.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.680
Listen to the guards.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.480
Of course.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.480
I promise I'll be good.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.960
I'll follow what the team says.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.640
Okay?

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.240
That's my girl.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.600
Ayla, I'm coming in.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.960
Dad!

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.000
Get out!

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.200
Dad…

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.280
Get her out of my house. Now!

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.680
Yes, sir.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.160
I said out!

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.040
No.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.760
I'm staying with Tawan.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.400
Bring Ayla here. And get her out of here!

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.280
Yes, sir. Please, Ms. Ayla. This way.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.080
Dad!

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.600
Let go!

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.040
Ouch!

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:53.920
Let her go!

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.000
Don't you dare touch my girl!

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.120
Ayla…

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.680
Are you hurt?

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.240
She's my daughter too!

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.520
Stay away from her!

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.040
Get her out of my house,

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.400
or I'll fire the entire company!

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.760
Sorry, Ms. Rawee.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.680
Please step outside.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.320
This way, ma'am.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.840
You two love each other so much,
you've completely forgotten about me, huh?

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.640
Do you even realize

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.560
how much this hurts me?

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.080
You want to hate me? Fine.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.920
You can't see my good intentions? Fine.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.000
But I'm angry too, Ayla.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.440
You broke the promise we made.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.280
And now, I'll keep mine.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.320
From this moment on,

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.800
you are not leaving this room!

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.320
Not until I'm convinced

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.080
you've cut ties with that woman!

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.120
I'll call the company
and cancel all your work.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.760
You're not ready to return yet.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.840
Now tell me.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.240
How have you been contacting her?

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.920
How?!

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.920
TAWAN

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.360
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.200
Do you know how disappointed I am in you?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.320
Don't let Ayla out of that room!

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.160
‎Let's go.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.360
Check on Ms. Ayla often, okay?

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.560
Yes, sir.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:48.200
-I climbed down from the balcony.
-Even we're ashamed of ourselves!

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:52.280
-We have to be embarrased!
-Right, we all are.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.480
Are you trying to steal our jobs now?

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.040
-Steal what job?
-Being a bodyguard!

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.520
What's with all the noise?

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:08.800
Tawan!

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.800
Ayla…

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.040
Hi!

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.560
Sorry to interrupt,

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.040
but we've been standing here
the whole time.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.360
You're not gonna yell at us later,
are you, Boss?

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.560
We were all stressed out.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.320
Aren't you even going to ask

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.240
how Ms. Ayla managed to get out?

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.840
I escaped to see you.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.480
I climbed down the balcony,
just like you did.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.120
It was so much fun.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.400
And there!

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.200
They helped me.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.800
Even drove me all the way here.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.080
Tell Chanon
these two are getting punished.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.280
You two are getting disciplinary action.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.360
You neglected your duties as bodyguards.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.920
Helping a VIP sneak out,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.600
whether you were tricked or not,
it's still wrong.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.560
But since we asked Chanon for help,

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.120
we'll take full accountability.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.560
Typhoon,

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.960
handle the transfer.
Move them over to our team.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.280
Yes, Boss.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:07.880
Thank you

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.760
for bringing Ayla here safely.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.640
You're welcome, Ms. Tawan.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.080
Sneaking out like this,

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.400
won't Mr. Thana be furious?

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:39.680
Of course he will. But I'm mad at him.
I'm not ready to talk to him yet.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.040
Tawan,

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.240
can you take me somewhere far away?

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.000
Somewhere Dad can't find us?

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:53.720
Okay.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.120
Let's go.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.520
Let me pack a few things first.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.400
Boss?

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.920
Wait, you're serious?

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.480
I'm taking Ayla on a short trip.
Just a few days.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.360
Then I'll bring her back home.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.200
-Yes.
-Yes, Boss.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.960
Find a way to inform Mr. Thana.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.960
Tell him Ayla is safe.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.240
I'll personally take her back.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.840
Yes, Boss.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.360
Is this your room?

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.320
Whoa…

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.360
It's like the sun's room
surrounded by moons.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.960
Don't tell me…

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.440
Seriously?

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.080
Yes.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.440
Tawan…

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.600
Yes?

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.600
We really can't just run away together?

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.920
I think

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.760
you already know the answer.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.480
I don't know what the future holds,

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.960
but my love for you

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.360
will never change.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.240
Do you trust me, Ayla?

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:42.960
I do.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.600
I'll be your one and only girl.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.160
And we'll never
let go of each other's hands.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.160
No matter what Dad says,

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.600
I'm not giving up on us. I won't let go.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.960
I'm super stubborn. Dad knows that.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:07.920
I know it too.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.920
You really are stubborn.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.120
So…

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.720
Where exactly are you taking me?

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.200
Where do you want to go?

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.720
I'll take you anywhere.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.200
Honestly?

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:38.320
I just wanna lie in bed with you all day.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:40.760
But…

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.880
that might be a little too lazy.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.520
Then…

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.360
let's not just lie around.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.400
Let's do something.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.520
Like what?

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.400
Well…

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.160
Like what?

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.280
I've seen your world.

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.880
Now I want you to see mine.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.320
Remember what I taught you?

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.560
Whatever happens, stay behind me.

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.480
So, you taught Ms. Ayla
how to fight and shoot

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.600
because you wanted her to protect herself?

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.480
Just in case.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.240
At least, if anything happens,

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.440
she'll know how to protect herself.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.960
You're good at this!

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:25.920
Yay!

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.320
I won!

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:18.520
I'm not eating anymore.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.760
What did you find out?

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:57.200
Our contact says Mr. Thana
handed some info to the police.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.280
They've collected evidence from the scene,

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.120
but the investigation's still ongoing.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.360
He's also tightened security everywhere,

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.520
at his house, the office,
and the project site.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.120
Everything's on high alert.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.280
And from what we know,

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.440
the people behind this are professionals.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:21.200
On the day of the shooting,

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.200
the car they used had fake plates.
No leads at all.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.720
As for the attackers,

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.400
they were completely covered up.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:32.000
Even the CCTV didn't get a clear shot.
Tracking them is going to be tough.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.760
What about the music label?

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.880
Anything suspicious?

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:38.800
CN hasn't reported anything yet.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.360
I think Mr. Thana's team can handle it.

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.360
But what worries me most…

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:48.880
The Boss Lady.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.800
Exactly.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.440
Because she's under the spotlight.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.160
But isn't she grounded right now?

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.480
Staying home should keep her safe.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:05.160
Trust me. Mr. Thana's
gonna let our Boss Lady work again.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.840
She's too rebellious.
Grounding her won't do a thing.

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.400
She'll be climbing down
balconies again for sure.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.960
We'd better step up the investigation.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.360
I don't want any more mistakes.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.240
Yes, Boss.

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.880
Time to wake up.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.840
You're up too early.
I don't wanna get up yet.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.200
I'm the early-rising sun, remember?

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.960
If you're the early-rising sun,

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.080
I'll be the moon that sleeps in.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.320
If the moon sleeps in,

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.680
the sun might sneak a kiss.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:01.120
Kiss me or do whatever you want.
I'm sleep-talking anyway.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.680
Okay, okay!

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.240
Eat it while it's hot.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.440
Here, I'll tear it

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.600
into bite-sized pieces for you.

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:23.840
Okay.

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:28.120
So, what are you gonna train me in today?

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:33.840
Can I just take my girlfriend out
on a proper date for once?

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.720
Sure!

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.520
Do you even know how sore I was yesterday?

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.240
I can barely lift my arm!

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.320
Where are we going today?

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.320
Thanks…

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.160
This makes me so happy.

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.000
I just wish
I could freeze time right here,

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.760
just the two of us.

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:14.520
But then again,

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:19.480
part of me wants to show you off to
the world, let everyone know you're mine!

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:25.880
Am I really that great
that you'd wanna show me off?

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.760
You are. Why?

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.280
I'm the child of a second wife.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:57.720
My mom was Dad's other wife.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.960
Not long after I was born,

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:05.680
she got sick and passed away.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:09.159
Left me all alone in this giant house.

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.400
It was huge,

00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:14.360
but it never felt like home.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:20.080
Can you sign my school leave form?

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:21.719
Wow!

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.760
You're an athlete?

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.719
That's impressive!

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:30.360
Dad's first wife and my half-brother

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:32.960
hated me.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.960
Dad kept trying to make us get along,

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:44.080
but I was always bullied,
always picked on.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.280
Hey! Go get the ball.

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.360
Aren't you the athlete? So good, right?

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:53.920
I tried to put up with it,

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:59.080
but I reached my limit.

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:14.520
A POWER-UP SNACK!
EAT IT AND YOU'LL HAVE LOTS OF ENERGY

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.040
Mek…

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.480
What's going on?

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.240
Mom! Mom!

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:35.120
Mek! Are you okay, sweetie?

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.000
You ungrateful little brat!

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.880
My goodness!

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.400
You have to deal with this brat!

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.760
So, what exactly happened?

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.600
My watch went missing,

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.520
so I searched her room.

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.640
She got mad and punched me.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.080
Were you searching,
or were you just trashing my room?

00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:59.040
Don't you talk back!

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.520
You wild child!

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.680
Picking fights with everyone,
you think I'll let this slide?

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.400
It's just kids fighting. Calm down.

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.360
Kids fighting?

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:10.880
Look at our son's face,

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.960
and look at hers.
Which one looks more beaten up?

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.880
Fine.

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.640
So? Did you find the watch?

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.480
-I did.
-Where?

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.400
I found--

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:33.080
Let's just say it was found. So what?

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.760
Either way, you have to deal with her.

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.280
She hurt Mek!

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:40.480
Okay.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:43.360
So, if she apologizes, that's it?

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.800
Tawan, just apologize.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:52.200
Dad… I didn't do anything wrong.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.120
-Yes, you did!
-I didn't.

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.280
You punched me!

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.680
Wanna check the cameras?
See who actually started it?

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:04.160
Fine. Let everyone see how you beat me up.

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:09.640
You need to deal with this brat!
I won't stand for this!

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:13.840
My daughter has a name, you know.
Speak to her with respect.

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.400
No, I won't.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.880
She's the second wife's kid.

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:24.920
Your mistress' child.
You're lucky I even let…

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:29.480
your dad raise you

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:31.120
in this house.

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:34.040
Then what do you want me to do
to make you happy?

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:36.640
Easy!

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:37.960
Kick her out.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:41.680
Send her to another country. Far away.

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.920
I don't wanna see your face again!

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.040
You better take care of it.
Or I won't let it go.

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.280
Fine.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:59.480
I'll leave.

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:00.920
And I won't come back.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:05.560
Good. Get lost.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.320
I never want to see your face again.

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.000
Go! This is my house!

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.720
So, I ended up living
with Auntie Mui and Uncle in Hong Kong.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:22.920
So…

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.560
How was it over there? Was it hard?

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.320
Not really.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.720
I worked and studied at the same time.

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.840
Was it hard? No.

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:40.200
But was it lonely? Definitely.

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:45.120
I was lucky

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:48.120
they loved me like their own.

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.440
Both of them

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:53.840
never had kids,

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.280
so they adopted me.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.640
That's when

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.280
I changed my last name.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.400
And after they passed,

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:07.200
I came back to start over in Thailand.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.440
There was no one left for me

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:13.600
over there.

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.800
So, I didn't see the point in staying.

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.920
I know

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.920
Auntie and Uncle would be so proud of you.

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:33.520
You've come so far on your own.

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.200
And about your dad,

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.640
I believe no father
could ever truly not love their child.

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.880
I'm proud of you, Tawan.

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.560
You're the best person in the world.

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:49.200
So good that I don't think

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:53.000
I'll ever find someone like you again.

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.000
You're incredible, out of this world!

00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:00.640
If you're ever scared that people
think you're not good enough,

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.360
just don't.

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.880
Don't overthink it, okay?

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.880
If anyone dares talk bad about you,

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.360
I'll protect you.
I'll take care of them myself.

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:13.040
Wow.

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:17.720
Amazing.
My girlfriend is the loveliest ever.

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:20.160
So now that I'm lovely, do you love me?

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.280
Good morning.

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.440
Oh!

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:25.040
Breakfast in bed?

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:26.640
Thank you.

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.560
You're welcome.

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.720
Thanks!

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.480
I don't wanna go home.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.640
I know I shouldn't whine,
since you already promised Dad.

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.320
I have to keep my word.

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:25.640
I'm just scared
he'll put me on lockdown again.

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:34.080
I believe Mr. Thana
knows his daughter well enough.

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:37.760
He knows how stubborn you are.

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:41.840
He probably doesn't want to see you

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:44.480
climbing down the balcony again.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.200
Let's hope he softens up soon.

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.240
Boss!

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:09.520
What is it?

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.240
Boss, where are you right now?

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.440
Why?

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:18.240
Can you check your messages?
We sent you something.

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:41.680
Our source says many reporters
are outside Ms. Ayla’s house.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:50.960
Alright, I'm hanging up.

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:13.520
Tomorrow at noon, I'll go live
and make a public statement.

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.080
The person in the photo is me.

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:17.920
Dad's precious daughter,

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.640
causing more drama for the family again.

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:22.880
Are you planning to stay
and drag our name down even further?

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:24.600
And who exactly is so disgraceful?

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.760
Can't you forgive Tawan's father, Dad?

00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:30.800
I told you to break up with her

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.720
because I'll never make peace with him.

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.040
If you want to love each other

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.520
while making me miserable,
then do whatever you want.

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:41.880
Do you really think we can be together
if both our dads refuse to accept it?

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:02.720

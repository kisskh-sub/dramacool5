00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.350
Wounds

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.380
heal so slowly.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.540
Hiding your happiness

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.480
is just so hard.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.660
My heart is soaring.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.300
Oh.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.530
So that's what this is.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.040
You two are dating.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:41.130
The thing is,

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.520
I'm usually pretty good at sensing these things.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.310
And you, Keishi,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.040
you could've just told me.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.960
You're letting your imagination run wild.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.110
So you two... aren't dating?

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.280
Of course not.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.480
No way.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.440
Besides,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.680
even if I were that way,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.380
it would never be with Tojo-san.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.760
(Maybe we could meet up this weekend?)

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.760
(No, better not. What happened last time
could happen again. Best to be careful.)

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.980
I just prefer being on my own.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.300
"10 Things I Want to Do Before I Turn 40"
(Episode 10)

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.460
It's almost here.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.060
The Christmas shopping season.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.740
I know it's going to be a tough time for everyone,

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:23.980
but let's all pull through together.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.310
Yes, sir!

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:37.840
Okay.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.630
According to the marketing department's research
for the Christmas shopping season,

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.620
the demographic with the highest willingness
to spend is, as expected, people in their 20s

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.890
and 30s.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.550
Careful now.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.800
Tojo-san, let me get that.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.800
Oh, thanks so much.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.860
Oh, if you could just take it...

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.600
Could you take it straight to the office?

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.040
- Oh, sure.
- Great. Be careful, and thanks.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.850
Man, Tojo-san is incredible.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.150
He even managed to move up
the year-end schedule...

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.330
A real pro can do anything.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.290
That's a veteran for you.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.160
Alright then.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.500
Let's get back to it.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.780
Right.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.220
You gotta eat well,

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.950
or you won't make it through the end of the year.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.400
Hey.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.040
You like this one, don't you?

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.320
How did you know?

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.340
What are you doing?

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.070
Are you free this weekend?

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:00.870
Huh?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.020
Want to come over to my place?

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.110
We're having a barbecue.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.360
A barbecue?

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.710
I barbecue in my yard all the time.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.930
I figured I'd invite you over for once.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.010
I mean, I can come, but what about your wife?

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.330
I'm on kid duty by myself.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.620
My wife's at her high school reunion.
She'll be out all day.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.200
I thought it'd be too much for her to take the girls along.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.510
Yeah, but...

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.260
- I don't know the first thing about kids...
- Suzume.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.400
That time in Osaka.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.750
You left early.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.900
You still

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.730
owe me

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.970
for that.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.990
Fine, I get it.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.330
So...

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.720
See you on Sunday.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.420
Yeah.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.670
Here, you have this one too.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.280
Okay.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.260
Thanks.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:10.570
Kuroki.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.460
Oh!

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.560
A weekend that wasn't on my list...

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.260
Suzume!

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:38.280
Huh?

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.000
What are you doing standing out front?

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.560
No, what are you doing here?

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:42.670
Suzume!

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.280
Oh, hi.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.310
- Hi.
- Hello!

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.500
Sorry for the intrusion.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.440
- Come on in.
- Please, come in.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.670
Alright, time for introductions.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:06.920
This is Mr. Suzume.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.200
Hey!

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.050
I'm Suzume.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.540
Okay, my oldest is Sakura.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.300
Then Aoi.

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:15.870
I'm Aoi!

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:17.710
And this is Sumire.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.260
Suzume!

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:20.850
Thanks.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.780
Anyway, sorry about this...

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:25.770
The propane tank

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:26.860
seems to be empty.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:28.010
I could've sworn I bought a new one.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.240
Oh, no. Want me to go get one?

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.310
No, no, no.
It's too heavy. You'd need a car.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.580
So...

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.870
- Could you hold her for me?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.070
Here you go...

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.270
Hehe, thanks in advance.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.220
Wait, can I really do this?

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.540
Just stay here with them.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:43.470
Um...

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.600
Can you tell me their names again?

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.320
The eldest is Sakura.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.680
- Sakura-chan.
- And then Aoi.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.610
- Aoi-chan.
- And Sumire.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:52.610
Sumire-chan.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.540
How long will you be?

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.900
Daddy...

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:59.590
is going to go buy some gas.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.360
You girls are going to stay home with Suzume-san.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:02.400
Okay?

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:02.660
Okay...

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:03.660
Okay, be safe.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:05.400
I'll be back in twenty or thirty minutes.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:06.810
Okay, thank you.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.120
Twenty or thirty minutes?

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.260
Yeah, sorry.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.580
- Suzume.
- Hm?

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.430
Put me down.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.140
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. Okay.

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:23.310
Suzume-san.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:26.890
- Looks like it's time to play house with Sumire-chan.
- Play house?

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.600
- Oh, thank you for the cookie.
- You're welcome...

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.210
Please, come in.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.100
Coming in.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.960
Huh? No way.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:44.470
Huh?

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:46.180
This is delicious. What is it?

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:48.790
You're amazing! But...

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.790
I'm not so sure about that carrot.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.110
No! No picky eating!

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.600
It's delicious.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.840
Eat up!

00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:59.850
Huh? Seriously?

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.070
Huh? This is so good!

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:05.730
Oh! So delicious!
Please give me more carrot!

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:10.370
Suzume-san, you're hilarious!
You're really good at playing house. Do you have kids?

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.030
No...

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:12.710
I'm not married.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.400
Then...

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.150
Will you marry Sumire-chan?

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.400
Well...
I'd need your dad's permission for that.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.970
And there's a big age gap, and many other issues...

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.440
She says that to everyone,
so you don't have to answer.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.180
Oh.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:27.540
Oh, I see.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:28.980
I see.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:33.630
By the way, Suzume-san,
are you really not married?

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:39.700
All of Dad's friends are married.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.770
And they all have kids, too.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.770
Aoi-chan, that's rude.
It doesn't matter if someone is married or not.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.560
- Okay...
- Okay.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.240
Sumire-chan, let's play.

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:56.690
Me too.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.270
When it comes to things like getting married or having kids,

00:09:58.510 --> 00:09:59.740
I've never been that interested.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.520
Oh...

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.210
- Oh, I see.
- Yeah.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.230
Seeing how hard it is for Mom and Dad to raise kids,

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.460
I've always thought being on my own is pretty great.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.150
But...

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.620
from my perspective,

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.710
I actually think it's lively and wonderful.

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:18.990
- You think so?
- Yeah.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:24.560
So, Suzume-san, have you decided
to spend your whole life by yourself?

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.050
Hmm... I guess you could say that.

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:30.150
In my case, I'm just going with the flow...

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:33.170
So right now,

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.480
do you ever feel lonely?

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:37.830
Sometimes I do,

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:39.050
but...

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.940
life on your own can be fun too.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:44.620
Oh? Like what?

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.900
For example...

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:51.470
like filling your room
with all the things you love.

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:53.510
So that means...

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.870
Suzume-san, are you the type who likes figurines?

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.380
Less like figurines and more...

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.800
something fluffier and softer...

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.240
Fluffy and soft?

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:04.990
Because this track...

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.360
is so hard!

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.110
Oh...

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.130
That track,

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:15.300
it really is pretty tough. Too bad.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.460
Don't tell me you're good at this.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.800
I've mastered all the classics.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.960
Then bring it on!

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:34.960
Whoa, that's a rocket start!

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:36.070
Rocket start!

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.160
We're neck and neck!

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.950
Oh no, you're ahead of me, you're ahead of me!

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:45.280
I got hit! Who threw a fireball?

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:47.050
Oh no.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:48.510
Who's in third place?

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:49.810
I'm home!

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.140
Whoa, amazing! Amazing!

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:52.220
Wait, wait!

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.290
Oh no, oh no, oh no!

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:55.660
It's a star! Use the star power!

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:57.110
Use the star!

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:58.670
Blast right through!

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:01.690
How about that?

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.150
We're neck and neck, huh?

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.010
Think they'll come over once it's ready?

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.760
Huh?

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:16.810
Are you okay?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Yeah, thanks.

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:23.280
By the way, how often do you guys have a barbecue?

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.580
Once a week...

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:25.810
Once a week?

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:26.590
For real?

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:27.670
For real.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:30.280
A barbecue once a week, that's amazing.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:32.600
Suzume, have a cookie.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.560
No, thanks.
We're about to eat, shouldn't I wait?

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:38.080
- Here, have this one.
- Oh, come on! It's fine.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:38.930
This stays between us, right?

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:40.830
That's Suzume for you.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.710
He's an instant hit with everyone.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:44.980
Alright~

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.500
The meat's ready. Anyone who wants some,
grab a plate and line up.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.520
Okay~

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:52.000
Here you go~

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:53.190
Thanks~

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:56.370
The crispy one and this big piece.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.440
The crispy one?

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.560
This one?

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:00.910
Have some of this too.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:02.570
Okay~

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:07.150
Sakura, do you want the fatty part?

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.370
No.

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:11.570
Okay~

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.020
After the meat, it's time for veggies~

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:15.900
Meat, vegetables.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:20.340
Protein, vitamins, minerals, right?

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.880
This is really a great day off.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.250
Suzume, you should eat up too.

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.950
You'll run out of steam for round two.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:29.330
Round two?

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.090
Sumire-chan said that later...

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.610
she wants to play tag with you, Suzume.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.920
It's gonna be a long game.

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:38.880
A long game?

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:39.960
And it gets intense.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.240
Her game of tag?

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.660
You'd better eat up and save your energy.

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:44.840
Good luck.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:49.040
- Again, again!
- Okay, one more time.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.740
Rock, paper, scissors!

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.260
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe!

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.920
Awwwww!

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.990
Me again?

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:58.590
Run!

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:03.090
Aaaaaah~

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:05.390
*Panting* I can't catch them...

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.090
Come this way~!

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.700
Don't run near the cars.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.190
And don't run towards the cars, either.

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:16.190
Be careful near the grill!

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.040
Watch out for the grill!

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.000
Yeah, be careful here...

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:24.630
My legs...

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:26.430
My legs are killing me...

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.070
You must be exhausted.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.630
Sumire-chan sure is full of energy.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.240
Kids have an amazing amount of stamina.

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:39.960
I admire you for being able to play with her every day.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.080
Once you hit 40, it's all downhill.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.690
The other day, I just tried to pick up Sumire-chan
and almost threw out my back.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.590
My stamina just isn't what it used to be.

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:55.000
I used an ab roller just once,
and my thighs were dead.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.100
And now I have to zoom in on my phone
to see anything clearly.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.770
- The day after a fun trip...
- The muscle pain doesn't kick in until three days later!

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:06.050
No kidding! I went to play squash a while back,
and couldn't even lift my arm the next day.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.220
What? You?

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.660
You actually went to play squash?

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:10.850
Ah...

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.400
It was just that one time.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.520
To lose some weight.

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:15.350
Sigh.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:17.610
This is the reality of being 40.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:20.730
But still...

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.550
Kuroki, you're amazing.

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:25.070
What's this all about?

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:25.720
Bringing this up out of the blue.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.310
While I was only focused on work...

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.990
you were raising kids. Three of them.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:34.700
When it comes to the kids,
I have my wife to thank for that.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:38.540
Among our colleagues,
you got married pretty early, didn't you?

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:40.740
Yeah.

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:45.070
I thought it was a bit fast, too.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:47.010
But more than that,

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.130
it was what I wanted to do.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:52.330
So,

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:56.070
I made up my mind back then.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:15:59.720
Made up your mind?

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:06.460
The resolve to be responsible
for another person's life, I suppose.

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:08.690
In other words,

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.920
the resolve to make someone happy?

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:14.920
I've realized that simply liking someone,

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:16.770
or being happy when you're together...

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:20.420
I've realized that's just not enough.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.700
Let me ask you something.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:35.310
You're forcing a smile.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.160
Is there something going on besides work?

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.280
No.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:48.930
I see.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.660
We started at this company together.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.180
If something's bothering you,

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:54.840
you can always talk to me.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.810
I'm on your side.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:04.580
Okay.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:06.460
Alright then,

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:09.780
Let's Showtime!

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:13.210
Huh?

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.510

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:15.700
No, thank you.

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:20.140
- I had a great time. Thanks.
- Let's play games again next time!

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.310
Of course. You too, Sumire-chan.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.080
Thank you too, Sakura-chan.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.080
Okay.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.550
Well, see you then.

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:32.610
- Good night. Bye-bye.
- It was so much fun. Bye-bye.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:35.450
Games! Games!

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.320
Hey.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:40.600
Hm?

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.100
What did you and Suzume-san talk about?

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:44.900
What's wrong?

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:47.390
Oh, nothing.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:50.720
He just seemed a little down.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:04.730
Is it the resolve to take on another person's life?

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:11.060
The resolve to take on another person's life...

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.940
Everyone, I'm home.

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:16.300
Welcome back.

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:17.790
Sorry I'm late.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:18.790
Welcome back.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.640
Did you fold the laundry?

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:21.960
It's folded, right?

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.580
No, it's not.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.190
Yes, it is! Look.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.560
I don't have any resolve to speak of...

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.600
Ah.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:35.750
I see.

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:37.540
You two are dating, aren't you!

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:41.570
And it could never be Tojo-san.

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:44.180
Backing down when it matters most.

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:49.300
And making Keishi say something like that.

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.140
Getting carried away with myself.

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:01.140
Thinking I had already overcome it.

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:04.090
This list... do you want to complete it with me?

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:07.850
Huh?

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:10.980
I'm just like Tojo-san.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:12.520
Tojo-san.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:14.800
Want to go to Bic Camera?

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:18.100
Let's go buy a takoyaki maker.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:19.970
Here you go.

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:21.930
No... I don't really feel like having any.

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:23.210
Why are you being so reserved?

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:24.910
Isn't that what today's for?

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:27.320
One Dark Mocha Cream Frappe.

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.260
Dark Mocha Cream Frappe, got it.

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:32.140
That's why...

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:34.590
please stop holding back.

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:35.850
When it comes down to it,

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:38.820
I've just been letting Keishi pull me along.

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.310
I didn't overcome it on my own at all.

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:46.520
I don't have the resolve to live on my own,

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:50.260
or the resolve to spend my life with someone.

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:55.780
Suzume-san.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:20:59.220
I'm sorry.

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.070
I really need to talk to you.

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:08.640
I'm sorry, please leave.

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:12.710
Wait.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:13.650
Hold on.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.720
I'm so sorry about that time.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.410
Please let me explain...

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:25.300
I...

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:29.740
I don't even know who I am anymore.

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:33.210
So...

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:39.120
Let's not see each other outside of work anymore.

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:49.710
Suzume-san!

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:26.770
Hey, Keishi...

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:28.450
I...

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.230
I don't know when it started,

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.890
but I've fallen so in love with you...

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.460
(Next Episode)
Everything you've worked so hard to build,

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.230
I'm going to destroy.

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:51.900
I acted like I knew it all.

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:53.690
I'm so sorry.

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:56.010
All I wanted
was to be with Suzume-san.

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:58.780
This is not where you belong.

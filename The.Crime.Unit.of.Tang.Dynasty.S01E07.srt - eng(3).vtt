00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:56.291
Sir, I truly apologize.

00:00:56.416 --> 00:00:57.458
My mistake, my mistake.

00:00:57.583 --> 00:00:59.208
Enough of that, just make your choice.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.583
So this time, could you possibly...

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.041
Lin Xiaoran.

00:01:11.916 --> 00:01:13.250
You're actually here?

00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.916
Official Li, I...

00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:22.291
We were just out for a walk and ended up here.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.250
Oh, Official Li.

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:27.958
These two honored guests have powerful connections.

00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.625
It's rare for them to visit today.

00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:31.041
There's a murder case at hand.

00:01:31.083 --> 00:01:32.791
And you still want to keep the business running?

00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:34.416
Oh, Official Li.

00:01:34.458 --> 00:01:36.083
Please, have mercy on me.

00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:39.166
I can't afford to offend any of these guests.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.208
I'm sure you're aware of that.

00:01:41.833 --> 00:01:43.000
Madam.

00:01:43.458 --> 00:01:45.500
You've misunderstood Official Li's intentions.

00:01:45.583 --> 00:01:47.875
Official Li means, since we're already here,

00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.833
would you really let him spend the night alone?

00:01:50.916 --> 00:01:51.875
Of course not.

00:01:51.916 --> 00:01:53.875
Official Li, which courtesan do you fancy?

00:01:53.916 --> 00:01:55.958
I'll send her to your room right away.

00:01:56.041 --> 00:01:57.958
Oh, Madam.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
What he means is, his tastes are a bit unusual.

00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:02.541
He doesn't like young ladies.

00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:04.375
He prefers older women.

00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:06.041
Lin Xiaoran, what nonsense are you talking?

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.000
So, what age does Official Li prefer?

00:02:10.041 --> 00:02:11.208
The older, the better.

00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:12.916
Oh, you must be joking.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.875
Liuxiang Pavilion doesn't have women like that.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.458
Then Madam herself would be perfect.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.875
Oh, stop making fun of me.

00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:21.875
Lin Xiaoran.

00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:22.541
Yes?

00:02:22.583 --> 00:02:23.541
Within ten feet.

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:27.416
Within ten feet.

00:02:36.666 --> 00:02:39.041
Sir, isn't it obvious?

00:02:39.416 --> 00:02:42.500
I heard this place used to be a deserted graveyard.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.041
Wanning was clearly possessed by a ghost long ago.

00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:48.208
Wanning was one of your courtesans too.

00:02:48.291 --> 00:02:49.708
Why are you so sure?

00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:52.250
Just look at her.

00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:54.166
She gets prettier every day.

00:02:54.333 --> 00:02:56.291
She charms the very souls out of the guests.

00:02:56.416 --> 00:02:58.750
If that's not a ghost, what is it?

00:02:59.541 --> 00:03:00.375
Sir.

00:03:00.541 --> 00:03:03.125
That Chunxiang just now isn't a good sort.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.083
She's always jealous of Wanning.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.041
She wishes something would happen to Wanning's clients so she'd lose favor.

00:03:09.541 --> 00:03:11.666
What about you? Aren't you jealous?

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:12.875
Me?

00:03:14.708 --> 00:03:16.416
Here in Liuxiang Pavilion,

00:03:16.666 --> 00:03:18.583
I'm the least attractive of all.

00:03:18.875 --> 00:03:20.125
I'm just here to make a living.

00:03:21.083 --> 00:03:22.041
Sir.

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:25.666
You don't suspect I had anything to do with Wanning's death, do you?

00:03:26.458 --> 00:03:28.458
I'm just a weak woman.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.541
Please don't accuse an innocent person.

00:03:30.583 --> 00:03:32.916
Did Wanning act strangely at all?

00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.250
We all just serve our own clients.

00:03:35.333 --> 00:03:37.750
Who has time to care about others?

00:03:38.875 --> 00:03:43.000
Sir, my rates are quite fair.

00:03:46.166 --> 00:03:48.416
So, how did you two living Zhuge Liangs do?

00:03:49.041 --> 00:03:51.000
Did you find anything out?

00:03:51.333 --> 00:03:54.333
The deceased just now was Official Zhang from the Luoyang Protectorate.

00:03:54.583 --> 00:03:56.083
He committed suicide out of guilt two years ago.

00:03:56.125 --> 00:03:58.750
The court let his case fizzle out.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.125
Most people who come here wear masks.

00:04:02.458 --> 00:04:03.416
It's very likely

00:04:03.666 --> 00:04:06.125
they're all people who can't show their faces in daylight.

00:04:06.833 --> 00:04:08.083
Xun Wan's death

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.375
is probably connected to this place too.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.333
Hey, Xiaoran.

00:04:14.416 --> 00:04:15.000
Yeah?

00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:16.458
You've been gone for so long.

00:04:16.916 --> 00:04:18.250
Did you find anything?

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.458
They all claim not to know Xun Wan.

00:04:22.916 --> 00:04:23.875
I think

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.958
we need to try other methods.

00:04:33.833 --> 00:04:34.791
Where are you going?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.708
I'm off to spend a night with someone.

00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:39.250
That brothel madam still has her charm.

00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:40.916
I'm leaving now.

00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.291
Official Li, aren't you coming with me?

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.333
I don't like older women.

00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:12.708
A woman who can wield a sword and roam the world—

00:05:13.041 --> 00:05:15.916
Lady Shen truly makes me envious.

00:05:20.916 --> 00:05:22.708
How you want to live

00:05:23.333 --> 00:05:25.041
is your own choice.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.333
It has nothing to do with being male or female.

00:05:29.583 --> 00:05:31.541
Miss Shen put it well.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.291
I hope that one day

00:05:36.416 --> 00:05:39.708
we can roam the world like Miss Shen.

00:05:42.333 --> 00:05:43.791
Wanning is dead.

00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:45.583
You two seem to get along better now.

00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:47.166
She deserved to die anyway.

00:05:47.541 --> 00:05:48.750
If not for her,

00:05:48.916 --> 00:05:50.791
we wouldn't be scolded for not being as pretty.

00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.625
Madam wouldn't beat and scold us every day.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.208
Sorry to keep everyone waiting.

00:06:10.458 --> 00:06:13.625
The Liuxiang Pavilion contest will now continue.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.333
Great, wonderful!

00:06:15.416 --> 00:06:17.166
Good, good.

00:06:19.916 --> 00:06:20.625
Good.

00:06:22.833 --> 00:06:23.500
This...

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.166
This...

00:06:26.375 --> 00:06:28.625
What is this?

00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.416
Oh no, this won't do.

00:06:32.166 --> 00:06:33.208
Would you choose this one?

00:06:33.208 --> 00:06:34.375
No interest, it's embarrassing.

00:06:34.375 --> 00:06:35.333
Not interested, right?

00:06:35.375 --> 00:06:36.500
Such a letdown.

00:06:37.833 --> 00:06:39.625
Couldn't you find someone prettier?

00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:43.541
Is this even presentable? Are there no ladies left?

00:06:45.041 --> 00:06:46.541
I don't want it, you take it.

00:06:46.625 --> 00:06:47.875
I don't want it either.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.166
Whoever wants it can keep it.

00:06:50.916 --> 00:06:51.916
No, no.

00:06:55.208 --> 00:06:56.208
Change it, please.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.666
Hey, Official Li.

00:06:59.375 --> 00:07:00.375
Official Li.

00:07:01.125 --> 00:07:01.791
What is it?

00:07:01.875 --> 00:07:03.625
Listen, this lady likes me.

00:07:03.666 --> 00:07:06.208
I don't have enough money, lend me some.

00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:15.000
This...

00:07:15.041 --> 00:07:16.291
This isn't enough money.

00:07:16.375 --> 00:07:18.833
What do you take our Madam for?

00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:19.833
Be generous, be generous!

00:07:19.916 --> 00:07:20.750
Don't go overboard.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.541
Be generous.

00:07:27.083 --> 00:07:28.166
Is this enough?

00:07:28.416 --> 00:07:29.500
Isn't this too much?

00:07:29.541 --> 00:07:30.666
It's just right.

00:07:32.666 --> 00:07:33.208
So expensive!

00:07:33.208 --> 00:07:35.250
Honored guest, please.

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:38.958
Wait for my news.

00:07:50.875 --> 00:07:52.041
Remember,

00:07:52.208 --> 00:07:55.875
you must leave before the candle burns out.

00:07:59.083 --> 00:08:02.083
Your money only covers this one candle.

00:08:26.916 --> 00:08:30.041
Sir, you're really handsome.

00:08:30.666 --> 00:08:32.875
Will you help me undress?

00:08:33.833 --> 00:08:34.666
Sure.

00:08:37.666 --> 00:08:41.666
Aren't you afraid there's a female ghost under my mask?

00:08:41.666 --> 00:08:44.166
Why not enjoy a night with a ghost?

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:48.333
Sir, don't let the candle go out.

00:08:48.416 --> 00:08:49.833
Rules are meant to be broken.

00:08:49.833 --> 00:08:51.458
Quick, undress, undress!

00:08:52.416 --> 00:08:53.750
You're so naughty.

00:08:55.416 --> 00:08:56.625
You're annoying.

00:09:13.791 --> 00:09:14.625
Alright, alright.

00:09:14.833 --> 00:09:16.458
I'm done playing, untie me.

00:09:16.541 --> 00:09:18.000
Oh, sir!

00:09:18.208 --> 00:09:20.875
Now that you're here, I don't plan to let you go.

00:09:21.333 --> 00:09:23.125
Miss, I'm really not here for fun today.

00:09:23.166 --> 00:09:24.208
I have something to ask you.

00:09:24.333 --> 00:09:25.416
Oh, it's fine.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.958
We can talk while we play, it's no problem.

00:09:27.041 --> 00:09:28.250
I'm sorry, isn't that enough?

00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:31.000
How about this: there's a handsome, rich man outside.

00:09:31.166 --> 00:09:32.750
I'll introduce him to you.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.250
Alright, what do you want to ask?

00:09:38.208 --> 00:09:39.375
Untie me first.

00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.875
Has this man, Xun Wan, ever been here?

00:09:55.208 --> 00:09:58.166
Oh, I think I've seen him.

00:09:58.708 --> 00:10:02.125
But that's not his name.

00:10:03.583 --> 00:10:04.458
Huh?

00:10:05.833 --> 00:10:07.791
Official Li, someone else has died.

00:10:09.416 --> 00:10:10.208
Let's go.

00:10:22.375 --> 00:10:23.250
When did it happen?

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.375
Just now.

00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:26.000
We just saw Wanning.

00:10:26.083 --> 00:10:28.333
She killed Chunxiang and Qiulan.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.333
Are you sure it was Wanning?

00:10:39.041 --> 00:10:40.791
Chunxiang, Qiulan.

00:10:41.125 --> 00:10:42.916
They just told me,

00:10:43.583 --> 00:10:46.833
that after Wanning died, they'd finally have their chance.

00:10:48.291 --> 00:10:50.833
Don't spread the word about this yet.

00:10:53.166 --> 00:10:54.000
Who is it?

00:10:54.291 --> 00:10:56.625
It's me. Do you think I'm a ghost?

00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.291
Were you really possessed?

00:11:00.041 --> 00:11:00.916
Yes.

00:11:03.208 --> 00:11:04.708
What did she talk to you about?

00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:08.791
Romance and lovers' bonds.

00:11:09.083 --> 00:11:10.083
Do you want to hear?

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:12.958
Official.

00:11:13.291 --> 00:11:15.041
Official, help us!

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.166
Two more courtesans have died.

00:11:17.291 --> 00:11:19.000
What should we do?

00:11:19.416 --> 00:11:20.875
Please save us, Official.

00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.083
The female ghost here—

00:11:22.208 --> 00:11:23.541
She won't let us go.

00:11:23.583 --> 00:11:25.166
There are no ghosts in this world.

00:11:25.541 --> 00:11:27.333
And ghosts don't kill people.

00:11:27.541 --> 00:11:29.750
But the courtesans all saw it.

00:11:30.458 --> 00:11:32.833
Did someone named Xun Wan come here?

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.208
I'm not sure about that.

00:11:35.333 --> 00:11:37.916
Guests here all use fake names.

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:44.625
Announce to the guests—

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.125
the contest will proceed as usual.

00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.125
But—

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:51.416
We're all waiting for the ghost to show up again.

00:11:57.541 --> 00:11:59.708
Relax.

00:12:01.083 --> 00:12:03.291
Since those officials gave the order,

00:12:03.375 --> 00:12:05.541
the bidding can't be stopped.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:08.208
I'm counting on you now.

00:12:08.875 --> 00:12:10.166
Now that Wanning is dead,

00:12:10.333 --> 00:12:11.916
those high-ranking officials

00:12:12.041 --> 00:12:14.750
will surely pay you endless silver.

00:12:15.125 --> 00:12:16.958
You should thank me properly.

00:12:23.166 --> 00:12:24.000
Enough.

00:12:48.416 --> 00:12:49.708
Ghost! Ghost!

00:12:51.375 --> 00:12:53.500
Official Li! Ghost! Ghost!

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:15.375
Yunjin, you wretched slave!

00:13:37.416 --> 00:13:38.416
Coming.

00:13:41.166 --> 00:13:43.291
Will you take it off yourself, or should I do it?

00:13:49.666 --> 00:13:50.750
Wanning.

00:13:52.291 --> 00:13:53.541
Why is it you?

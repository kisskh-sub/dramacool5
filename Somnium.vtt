02:31.402 --> 02:32.402
Hello?

02:32.403 --> 02:33.319
Hey, Budget Movers.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.529
Oh! Uh, yeah, I--

02:34.530 --> 02:36.531
We're unloading your stuff
on Russell.

02:36.532 --> 02:37.532
I'll be right down
to let you in.

02:37.533 --> 02:38.491
Alright, thanks.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.410
Okay.

02:56.844 --> 03:00.555
Approaching Hollywood
and Edgemont followed by--

03:24.663 --> 03:26.498
Uh, excuse me?

03:26.665 --> 03:27.791
Oh, hi, sorry.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.209
How can I help you?

03:29.376 --> 03:30.878
Oh, no, I, um--

03:31.045 --> 03:32.587
I just moved to town
and I was wonderin'

03:32.588 --> 03:34.423
if y'all were hirin' by chance?

03:35.799 --> 03:38.761
Oh, yeah, no.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.264
Well, do you think I could
leave my résumé with you,

03:42.431 --> 03:43.265
just in case?

03:44.642 --> 03:45.809
Yeah, no.

03:46.936 --> 03:49.271
Doesn't really work that way.

03:49.438 --> 03:50.272
Sorry.

03:50.439 --> 03:52.358
But good luck.

03:55.694 --> 03:56.570
Idiot.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.657
At Somnium, those dreams
can become your reality.

04:42.658 --> 04:44.492
Hi. Welcome.

04:44.493 --> 04:45.410
Hi.

04:45.411 --> 04:46.787
How can we help you?

04:46.954 --> 04:50.165
Um, I saw your "Now Hiring" sign
out front.

04:50.332 --> 04:52.918
Dr. Shaffer is busy
for the rest of the day,

04:53.085 --> 04:55.212
but I can take your résumé.

04:55.379 --> 04:57.714
Um, okay.

04:57.715 --> 05:00.758
...ultimately manifesting
in your real waking life.

05:00.759 --> 05:02.553
Sorry, what is it
that y'all do here?

05:03.220 --> 05:04.346
We make dreams come true.

05:05.139 --> 05:06.222
...within just two months
of treatment...

05:06.223 --> 05:07.265
Here for the job opening?

05:07.266 --> 05:08.183
Mm-hmm.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.434
Why don't you come back
into my office?

05:09.435 --> 05:11.145
I have few minutes
before my last consultation.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.772
...a six-week
integration program

05:13.897 --> 05:16.567
accustomed to you
and your unique dreams.

05:17.276 --> 05:18.402
Have a seat.

05:18.569 --> 05:19.486
Make yourself at home.

05:26.785 --> 05:28.703
So, what brought you in today?

05:28.704 --> 05:30.747
Um, well, I was just--
I was passing by

05:30.748 --> 05:32.332
and I saw your "Now Hiring" sign
out front,

05:32.499 --> 05:35.878
and I just moved into town,
so I'm looking for a job,

05:36.045 --> 05:38.547
and I'd take anything
at this point.

05:38.714 --> 05:39.714
Where'd you move from?

05:39.715 --> 05:42.801
Um, just a small town
in Georgia.

05:42.926 --> 05:44.344
What kinda work
were you doin' there?

05:44.511 --> 05:46.555
Just waiting tables
at my parents' diner.

05:46.722 --> 05:48.682
The night shift
while I finished up school.

05:48.807 --> 05:50.309
What'd you study?

05:50.476 --> 05:53.520
Um, two years of literature
until I had the guts

05:53.687 --> 05:54.729
to switch to acting.

05:54.730 --> 05:55.689
Hmm.

05:55.814 --> 05:56.982
Well look, um--

05:57.983 --> 05:59.568
- I'm sorry, what was your name?
- Gemma.

05:59.735 --> 06:02.154
I'll have to tell you, Gemma,
this position has been

06:02.321 --> 06:04.322
a bit of a nightmare to fill.

06:04.323 --> 06:05.239
The hours are long

06:05.240 --> 06:07.326
and the shifts
are all overnights.

06:07.493 --> 06:09.620
But you said you worked nights
back home, right?

06:09.787 --> 06:12.414
Oh, yeah, it's a 24-hour diner,
so I'm used to it.

06:12.581 --> 06:15.000
Okay, well,
aside from the odd hours,

06:15.167 --> 06:16.877
the job is quite simple, actually.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.836
We call it our sleep sitter.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.506
Sleep sitter?

06:20.672 --> 06:23.050
Our groundskeeper,
if you will.

06:23.217 --> 06:24.635
All you have to do is just
make sure

06:24.802 --> 06:27.596
the clients are asleep soundly,
doors are locked,

06:27.763 --> 06:29.014
hallway's clear.

06:29.181 --> 06:31.308
Pay is minimal. 600 a week.

06:31.475 --> 06:34.019
But you'll have your afternoons
free for auditions.

06:35.020 --> 06:37.022
So if you're still interested,

06:37.189 --> 06:38.773
why don't you come back
in next Thursday evening,

06:38.774 --> 06:40.359
say around 10:00 p.m.?

06:40.526 --> 06:41.860
I'll have Noah
show you the ropes.

06:41.985 --> 06:43.778
Call it a trial shift.

06:43.779 --> 06:44.988
How's that sound?

06:45.322 --> 06:48.450
That-- that sounds great.
Yeah, yeah, um, thank you.

09:11.009 --> 09:12.511
January 23rd.

09:13.345 --> 09:15.347
Remember that boy, Hunter,

09:15.514 --> 09:17.224
I used to have a crush on
in middle school?

09:17.391 --> 09:18.433
Can I ask you a question?

09:18.767 --> 09:19.851
The one whose sister
I used to tutor?

09:20.102 --> 09:21.019
- I have a question!
- Okay.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.646
I have a very serious question.

09:22.938 --> 09:24.856
Well, guess who's been
showin' up at the diner lately.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.568
What you wanna
do with your life?

09:28.735 --> 09:29.944
I wanna be an actor.

09:29.945 --> 09:31.238
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.240
No way! An actor?

09:34.616 --> 09:35.617
Like, a movie star?

09:35.784 --> 09:37.034
Mm-hmm. I'm gonna be.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.953
Should I get your autograph now?

09:38.954 --> 09:39.954
No, seriously,
should I get it now

09:39.955 --> 09:41.038
or should I wait?

09:41.039 --> 09:41.956
'Cause I feel like once
you're famous,

09:41.957 --> 09:43.292
I might not be able to get it.

09:44.668 --> 09:47.129
What do you wanna do
with your life, Hunter Higdon?

09:50.507 --> 09:51.341
Well...

09:54.511 --> 09:56.013
Well, actually,
I'd love to play music.

09:58.181 --> 09:59.432
What?

09:59.433 --> 10:00.349
I mean, I don't--
I don't need to be,

10:00.350 --> 10:02.184
like, a big deal or anything

10:02.185 --> 10:04.979
but join a band

10:04.980 --> 10:07.607
and maybe sign
with a small label.

10:07.774 --> 10:08.734
Go on tour.

10:12.821 --> 10:13.655
But...

10:14.781 --> 10:17.534
...what am I probably
gonna do, like, for real?

10:17.701 --> 10:19.994
Um, I work-- you know I work
for my dad's garage, right?

10:19.995 --> 10:22.706
Yeah, so I'll keep doing that,
and probably take it over,

10:22.873 --> 10:25.917
and find a piece of land,

10:26.084 --> 10:28.002
build a house.

10:28.003 --> 10:29.880
I'm a simple guy,
I don't really need much.

10:36.094 --> 10:37.637
What kinda house
would you build?

10:41.767 --> 10:42.768
Wait.

10:46.188 --> 10:47.522
Oh, man.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.650
Let's see.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.423
You forgot your roof.

11:13.590 --> 11:14.633
No, that's a skylight.

11:15.634 --> 11:16.884
That's a skylight.

11:29.022 --> 11:32.025
Approaching Hollywood
and Gower.

11:35.487 --> 11:38.072
Most clients see results
within just two months

11:38.073 --> 11:39.825
of treatment completion.

11:39.991 --> 11:43.787
The Somnium process
was perfected for over 15 years

11:43.954 --> 11:48.041
by esteemed sports psychologist
Dr. Katherine Shaffer.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.001
Shaffer gained notori--

11:50.168 --> 11:52.086
She was a sports coach?

11:52.087 --> 11:53.380
A sports psychologist.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.840
Uh, she developed what they call
the science of winning.

11:55.841 --> 11:59.176
Uh, Olympians, pro golfers,
football quarterbacks,

11:59.177 --> 12:00.929
you name it,
she helped them win.

12:01.096 --> 12:02.096
Woman's a genius.

12:02.097 --> 12:03.557
So, why'd she stop?

12:04.349 --> 12:05.642
Stopped to open this place.

12:07.853 --> 12:09.062
Come on, this way.

12:12.190 --> 12:13.775
Here, look.

12:17.737 --> 12:18.697
What is it?

12:20.282 --> 12:21.408
It's a sleep pod.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.118
Blocks out all light and sound.

12:24.494 --> 12:27.121
Have you ever been in
a sensory deprivation chamber?

12:27.122 --> 12:28.290
Mm-mm.

12:31.793 --> 12:32.711
Come here.

12:37.716 --> 12:40.010
Wait, are you sure
we're supposed to be in here?

12:40.177 --> 12:41.887
Yeah, we can't wake them.

12:44.222 --> 12:46.349
So, Joe here

12:46.516 --> 12:49.769
dreams of becoming a husband,
a father,

12:49.936 --> 12:52.939
and developing an app that'll
change the world for the better.

12:54.483 --> 12:56.234
Right now,
he's just a hopeless romantic

12:56.359 --> 12:57.944
with a programming hobby.

13:01.031 --> 13:02.114
...and a deeper understanding

13:02.115 --> 13:04.409
of social issues
and user behaviors.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.412
So, they sleep and this thing

13:07.579 --> 13:10.123
just plays pictures
and sounds of what they want?

13:10.248 --> 13:13.167
Basically, they're swimming
beneath the surface of an ocean

13:13.168 --> 13:14.251
of subconscious.

13:14.252 --> 13:16.170
The boundaries of their egos
loosen,

13:16.171 --> 13:17.255
turning them into sponges

13:17.380 --> 13:19.841
absorbing everything
that they see and hear.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.635
The information we program
gets stored

13:21.801 --> 13:24.596
and processed like memories,
deep within the subconscious,

13:24.763 --> 13:29.017
and then, after six weeks,
it's like, deep down,

13:29.184 --> 13:31.269
they believe these things
to be personal truths.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.355
Like they're destined for them,

13:33.522 --> 13:34.981
as inevitably
as they're destined to grow old

13:35.148 --> 13:36.691
and die.

13:36.858 --> 13:40.194
It's that deep belief
that manifests these dreams

13:40.195 --> 13:41.488
into reality.

13:43.323 --> 13:46.451
But, does it actually change
their reality

13:46.618 --> 13:48.370
or just their perception of it?

13:50.622 --> 13:51.873
What's the difference?

13:54.292 --> 13:57.671
So, what exactly
is my job going to be then?

13:59.005 --> 14:00.297
You just keep an eye on
the security monitors,

14:00.298 --> 14:02.509
make rounds,
and call Shaffer

14:02.676 --> 14:04.219
if anything seems
out of the ordinary.

14:05.303 --> 14:07.305
Um, hardest part of the job
is just the hours.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.223
I'll work here overnight
sometimes,

14:09.224 --> 14:11.225
when I'm catching up
on the next round.

14:11.226 --> 14:14.271
Otherwise, it can get pretty
quiet during the night shifts.

14:18.316 --> 14:20.193
Here, this way.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.949
So, we can head back upstairs
to Shaffer's office

14:26.116 --> 14:27.492
and get you your uniform.

14:35.584 --> 14:38.252
Uh, I forget
where she keeps them.

14:38.253 --> 14:39.211
Can you check the cabinets?

14:39.212 --> 14:40.130
Mm-hmm.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.799
What's with all the boxes?

14:42.966 --> 14:46.260
Oh, you didn't hear from me,
but she's planning on retiring.

14:46.261 --> 14:47.721
Really?

14:47.887 --> 14:49.889
What's she gonna
do with this place?

14:50.056 --> 14:51.391
She hasn't said yet.

14:51.558 --> 14:52.809
But don't expect
to see her much.

14:52.976 --> 14:55.020
She only comes in
for consultations.

14:55.937 --> 14:57.355
I'm lead dream designer,
so anything you need from her

14:57.480 --> 14:59.357
can go through me.

14:59.524 --> 15:01.276
And then what
about the other girl?

15:02.193 --> 15:03.361
- Olivia?
- Mm-hmm.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.279
Uh, she works the front desk
until you come in

15:05.280 --> 15:06.573
for night shifts.

15:08.658 --> 15:11.244
So, what do y'all do
on your nights off?

15:13.079 --> 15:15.372
Olivia hangs out at the arcade
down the street.

15:15.373 --> 15:18.043
Personally, I don't
really take nights off.

15:18.877 --> 15:21.254
We get break weeks, of course.

15:21.379 --> 15:23.548
Uh, and Saturdays
are reset days.

15:23.715 --> 15:26.300
But otherwise, the process
has to run consecutively,

15:26.301 --> 15:27.385
six weeks each straight through.

15:27.510 --> 15:30.388
And we don't get nights off
during those weeks.

15:30.555 --> 15:32.015
If you're planning on
some big social life,

15:32.182 --> 15:33.975
this probably isn't the job
for you.

15:36.394 --> 15:37.354
Here we go.

15:41.399 --> 15:43.359
Um, this should work for now.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.653
I'm gonna take my five out front

15:44.819 --> 15:47.280
and I'll see you back here
in a few.

16:01.419 --> 16:03.213
Star of the most talked-about
film of the year,

16:03.380 --> 16:06.007
ladies and gentlemen,
this woman is everywhere.

16:06.174 --> 16:07.341
You can't miss her.

16:07.342 --> 16:11.137
So, let's have a warm welcome
for, the one-name sensation,

16:11.304 --> 16:12.138
Max!

16:16.351 --> 16:17.185
Hi.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.270
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Oh, hi.

16:23.358 --> 16:25.275
Well, this is our
first time meeting.

16:25.276 --> 16:26.361
Thanks so much for coming.

16:26.653 --> 16:27.986
Thanks for having me,
I'm a fan as well.

16:27.987 --> 16:31.199
So anyway, Max,
how does it feel?

16:31.366 --> 16:32.366
How does what feel?

16:32.367 --> 16:33.535
I don't know.

16:33.702 --> 16:34.869
Having everything
you've ever wanted.

16:36.538 --> 16:37.621
Uh, but does it ever get old,

16:37.622 --> 16:39.373
everyone wanting to be
your friend?

16:39.374 --> 16:41.668
I mean, how does that feel?

16:41.835 --> 16:43.294
You gotta have
the right friends.

16:43.461 --> 16:44.294
You-- friends,
you gotta have the right--

16:44.295 --> 16:45.296
It's all about who you know.

16:45.463 --> 16:47.048
Ah.

17:22.959 --> 17:24.252
Okay, wait, I don't know.

17:24.419 --> 17:25.962
Well, like, what do you
want me to do, though?

17:26.129 --> 17:27.756
You could change
your mind, you know?

17:31.468 --> 17:33.094
- It's not my fault.
- Yeah, it's almost done.

17:33.261 --> 17:34.095
Can we go short?

17:34.554 --> 17:35.930
- How about, like, right up here?
- No!

17:41.811 --> 17:43.646
- Just like a sliver.
- Mm-hmm.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.473
Hey, um, have--
have you guys seen Olivia

18:19.474 --> 18:20.475
around at all tonight?

18:20.600 --> 18:22.101
Take cover!

18:22.227 --> 18:23.060
What?

18:23.061 --> 18:25.396
I was just asking
if you've seen Olivia.

18:25.563 --> 18:26.689
Is she hot?

18:27.232 --> 18:28.066
What?

18:28.525 --> 18:30.067
Look, I don't know
who you're talkin' about,

18:30.068 --> 18:31.527
but I'm about to beat
my high score

18:31.528 --> 18:33.321
so could you skedaddle, princess?

18:34.823 --> 18:35.990
Under fire!

18:50.046 --> 18:50.922
Hi.

19:08.356 --> 19:10.066
Idiot. Idiot.

19:10.233 --> 19:11.234
Idiot.

19:15.613 --> 19:16.614
Is everything okay?

19:16.781 --> 19:19.450
Oh, yeah, I was just, um, I...

19:19.617 --> 19:20.492
I didn't mean to startle you.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.120
No, you-- you didn't startle me.

19:23.788 --> 19:24.998
What's your name?

19:26.416 --> 19:29.127
Gemma.

19:29.294 --> 19:30.128
Where you from?

19:31.421 --> 19:35.675
Just... just this small town
in southern Georgia

19:35.842 --> 19:37.551
you've probably
never heard of.

19:37.552 --> 19:38.803
What brings you here?

19:40.346 --> 19:45.226
Well, um, 'cause I wanna be
an actress.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.479
Just like everyone else here,
I guess.

19:50.273 --> 19:54.068
Well, if you need anything,
you give me a shout.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.113
I'll show you around town.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.655
Brooks.

19:58.656 --> 20:00.283
Keep your head up, kid.

20:00.450 --> 20:01.284
Thanks.

20:17.675 --> 20:18.551
Whoa.

20:21.554 --> 20:22.430
I got an audition.

20:49.123 --> 20:50.708
I've got nothing to say.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.585
I've got nothing to say.

20:54.629 --> 20:55.713
Not as nice as--

20:56.714 --> 20:58.341
Not as nice as you, I suspect.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.178
I would never say that.

21:02.345 --> 21:03.637
But she would, Gemma,
that's the point.

21:03.638 --> 21:04.722
Okay.

21:05.723 --> 21:07.809
Not as nice as you, I suspect.

21:07.976 --> 21:09.643
I see the way you look at her.

21:09.644 --> 21:12.355
- Boo!
- Oh, my God!

21:12.522 --> 21:14.774
Hey.

21:16.150 --> 21:18.069
So, that's the big dream, huh?

21:18.236 --> 21:19.278
Acting?

21:19.445 --> 21:20.654
Uh, yeah.

21:20.655 --> 21:21.990
Yeah, I guess so.

21:22.156 --> 21:24.325
You know, I was in
a commercial once.

21:25.702 --> 21:27.661
National Mattress store ad.

21:27.662 --> 21:29.497
Everyone said
I had a future in it

21:29.664 --> 21:33.167
but I found the whole thing
to be a bit vapid.

21:33.334 --> 21:34.460
You know?

21:38.756 --> 21:42.635
Hey, um, do you wanna see
what I'm workin' on?

21:42.760 --> 21:43.760
Yeah, sure.

21:43.761 --> 21:44.846
Yeah?

21:48.307 --> 21:50.018
So, we got this guy
in the next round.

21:50.184 --> 21:51.936
Wants a political career,

21:52.103 --> 21:55.731
travel, family, fame,
all of it, of course.

21:55.732 --> 21:57.691
They all want the same shit.

21:59.068 --> 22:02.030
So, I've already got his
career stuff mapped out, right?

22:02.196 --> 22:03.030
Easy.

22:03.031 --> 22:05.324
For the fame,
I've got a template for that

22:05.491 --> 22:06.700
at this point.

22:06.701 --> 22:10.704
But the thing that I've been
stuck on is this guy's wife.

22:10.705 --> 22:15.043
It's like, "Do you just want
someone to fit the program?

22:15.209 --> 22:16.961
Someone who checks
all the boxes?

22:17.128 --> 22:20.714
Or someone that he could
actually fall in love with?"

22:20.715 --> 22:21.715
You know?

22:21.716 --> 22:24.218
And, if so...

22:26.804 --> 22:27.930
who would she be?

22:35.146 --> 22:37.731
Wait. Delete that!

22:37.732 --> 22:39.400
Just check this out.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.736
So, I enter the client
selections into the AI,

22:42.737 --> 22:44.155
and it spits out the visuals.

22:45.948 --> 22:47.033
The more detail, the better.

22:48.826 --> 22:51.245
I live each day to the fullest,

22:51.412 --> 22:54.040
rooting myself
into the present moment.

22:55.124 --> 22:57.751
I feel a deep sense
of freedom,

22:57.752 --> 23:00.505
every day, a grand adventure.

23:00.671 --> 23:02.465
But what if I told you
I had more control?

23:02.632 --> 23:04.425
...top performer.

23:04.592 --> 23:05.634
My partner loves...

23:05.635 --> 23:06.803
Wait, is that supposed to be me?

23:07.595 --> 23:09.555
What the hell?

23:09.722 --> 23:11.057
How did you do that?

23:11.224 --> 23:12.725
Delete it.

23:15.436 --> 23:17.939
You know,
I could leave this here,

23:18.106 --> 23:19.190
and in six weeks,

23:19.398 --> 23:21.359
this guy would wake up
madly in love with you.

23:21.484 --> 23:22.902
He'd see you
on some street corner

23:23.069 --> 23:24.778
and he'd try to remember
where he knows you from,

23:24.779 --> 23:26.072
whether it was a random passing

23:26.489 --> 23:29.534
or maybe you guys sat next to
each other on a flight recently.

23:30.535 --> 23:33.663
But he'd chase you down just
for the chance to ask you out.

23:36.624 --> 23:39.127
That's kinda terrifying
that you can just do that.

23:39.877 --> 23:41.295
I can do anything.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.090
Like, that acting career
of yours,

23:44.340 --> 23:46.675
just as easy as I can make him
fall in love with you.

23:46.676 --> 23:49.554
I could put you on TV screens
and movie billboards,

23:49.720 --> 23:53.224
and he'd wake up thinking
you're the next big thing.

23:55.101 --> 23:56.727
Do you even know
how many producers

23:56.894 --> 23:58.020
and directors we get in here?

24:05.278 --> 24:08.739
Hey, uh, do you
have a boyfriend?

24:09.866 --> 24:11.242
No.

24:11.409 --> 24:12.826
Why, do you want
to program me one?

24:15.204 --> 24:18.166
Yeah, that, or, um...

24:20.251 --> 24:22.919
I don't know, uh, may-- maybe...

24:22.920 --> 24:25.339
Maybe we could go out sometime?

24:31.929 --> 24:33.181
Hi.

24:33.347 --> 24:34.265
Welcome.

24:34.932 --> 24:35.933
How are you?

24:36.100 --> 24:37.393
I'm doing pretty well, thanks.

24:38.936 --> 24:40.688
Bethany will take your headshot
and résumé.

24:40.855 --> 24:42.565
Oh! Oh, that's-- sure.

24:46.235 --> 24:47.110
Alright.

24:47.111 --> 24:48.613
So, go ahead
and stand on the mark.

24:48.779 --> 24:52.241
Slate your name, your height
and the part you're reading for,

24:52.408 --> 24:54.951
and we're gonna run
the scene all the way through,

24:54.952 --> 24:57.580
and Kevin is gonna read
for Charles.

24:57.747 --> 24:58.915
How you doin'?

25:02.585 --> 25:03.836
Nervous?

25:03.961 --> 25:04.878
Nope.

25:04.879 --> 25:05.880
Great.

25:06.964 --> 25:07.965
Whenever you're ready.

25:12.970 --> 25:15.181
Hi, I'm Gemma Solomon,
I'm 5'7",

25:15.348 --> 25:17.350
and I'm reading for the role
of Miranda.

25:19.769 --> 25:20.894
You know,
you could say something.

25:20.895 --> 25:22.521
You've been quiet
the entire drive.

25:23.731 --> 25:24.940
I've got nothing to say.

25:24.941 --> 25:26.776
Well, did you have a nice time?

25:26.943 --> 25:28.486
Not as nice as you, I suspect.

25:29.695 --> 25:31.447
Is there somethin'
you wanted to talk about?

25:31.614 --> 25:33.074
Is there somethin'
on your mind?

25:35.993 --> 25:37.911
I see the way you look at her.

25:37.912 --> 25:38.996
I'm no fool, Charles.

25:39.163 --> 25:40.580
Look at who?

25:40.581 --> 25:41.539
Kaitlin.

25:41.540 --> 25:42.791
It's always Kaitlin.

25:42.792 --> 25:44.000
My work partner?

25:44.001 --> 25:44.960
Miranda, that's ridiculous--

25:44.961 --> 25:46.712
You're in love with her,
Charles!

25:46.879 --> 25:47.921
Just say it!

25:47.922 --> 25:49.924
I can see it in the way
you look at her!

25:51.968 --> 25:53.094
I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

25:53.261 --> 25:54.804
I think you've had
too much to drink.

25:56.973 --> 25:58.641
When did it change for you?

25:59.267 --> 26:01.269
Do you remember the moment?

26:01.435 --> 26:03.396
I don't know
what you're gettin' at.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.064
You used to look
at me like that.

26:06.399 --> 26:10.027
You used to look at me like...
like I was made of magic.

26:10.194 --> 26:12.113
You used to look at me
and your eyes lit up.

26:14.031 --> 26:15.533
When did you stop seeing me?

26:18.452 --> 26:20.579
Let's talk about this
another time.

26:20.746 --> 26:21.580
You're tired,
let's get some sleep.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.582
No, I ca--
I can't wait until morning!

26:24.333 --> 26:26.042
Every morning I wake up,
and you're gone,

26:26.043 --> 26:28.003
and I know that you're with her
and that

26:28.004 --> 26:29.463
that's enough for you.

26:30.631 --> 26:32.508
Well, I can't do this anymore.

26:32.675 --> 26:34.510
You've shut me
out of your heart.

26:36.804 --> 26:38.972
Just tell me to go, Charles,
and I'll go.

26:38.973 --> 26:40.850
Just tell me to leave.

26:48.357 --> 26:50.359
It's-- it's very good.

26:51.736 --> 26:52.862
It's very good.

26:53.029 --> 26:55.072
Um, thanks, Gemma.

26:55.197 --> 26:56.699
That-- that's all?

26:57.491 --> 26:58.492
- That's it.
- Okay.

26:58.659 --> 27:00.703
We have you on tape,
we'll be in touch.

27:01.412 --> 27:02.997
Okay. Okay.

27:11.964 --> 27:12.882
Uh, Dakota?

27:33.694 --> 27:34.527
Shit.

27:34.528 --> 27:35.488
Already?

28:40.177 --> 28:41.303
Hello?

28:56.402 --> 29:00.698
I have bravely and fully
opened my heart again.

29:02.199 --> 29:05.911
My greatest love story
is unfolding around me.

29:07.496 --> 29:10.082
I am easy to love.

29:11.625 --> 29:14.336
My partner is deeply
attracted to me.

29:16.338 --> 29:19.216
I have attracted
my perfect match into my life.

29:22.970 --> 29:26.599
I am at my ideal
and healthy weight.

29:26.765 --> 29:30.269
I really enjoy what I see
when I look in the mirror.

29:32.396 --> 29:36.317
I feel so good in my own skin.

29:38.611 --> 29:42.364
I have great posture
and love my form.

30:02.760 --> 30:03.719
Hello?

30:08.891 --> 30:12.185
I have freed myself
from all destructive doubt

30:12.186 --> 30:13.687
and fear.

30:15.940 --> 30:18.817
No one is more worthy
of success than I am.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.533
Olivia, there's-- there's
something in there!

30:25.699 --> 30:27.409
- In where?
- In the-- in the room!

30:27.576 --> 30:29.202
There's like a-- a creature
or something in there.

30:29.203 --> 30:30.120
- Can you--
- A-- a client?

30:30.287 --> 30:31.120
No, no, it's not a client.

30:31.121 --> 30:32.373
Can you just look? Please.

30:32.540 --> 30:34.542
- Could you go look?
- Yeah, okay, okay.

30:34.708 --> 30:35.709
Okay.

30:41.966 --> 30:44.385
I experience breakthroughs
daily.

30:46.554 --> 30:49.473
I am working
in perfect alignment.

30:51.183 --> 30:54.687
I am...
walking

30:54.853 --> 30:56.981
in the fullness of
my potential.

30:58.524 --> 30:59.817
You should get some sleep.

31:00.025 --> 31:02.903
easily

31:03.028 --> 31:05.781
and effortlessly
with increasing magnitude.

31:08.993 --> 31:12.204
This is a significant step
in my life journey.

31:15.541 --> 31:16.374
Hey!

31:16.375 --> 31:17.585
Hannah!

31:17.751 --> 31:18.627
Oh, my God, hold on.

31:18.794 --> 31:20.087
I'm trying to find
a quiet place to talk.

31:20.254 --> 31:21.338
Where are you?

31:21.463 --> 31:22.715
I'm at Luke's .

31:22.840 --> 31:25.134
His parents are out of town,
so he's having people over.

31:25.301 --> 31:26.259
Oh, my God, how are you?

31:26.260 --> 31:27.302
Tell me everything!

31:27.303 --> 31:28.345
I'm-- I'm good.

31:28.512 --> 31:30.139
Um, I'm okay.

31:30.306 --> 31:31.264
I-- I got a job already.

31:31.265 --> 31:35.019
But it's the graveyard shift,
so my hours are all backwards.

31:35.185 --> 31:37.521
Well, if it doesn't work out,
you can always come home

31:37.688 --> 31:38.856
and move back to me.

31:39.815 --> 31:41.358
Right.

31:41.483 --> 31:43.861
Please, Gemma, I can't
stand this place without you.

31:44.028 --> 31:44.902
How is everyone?

31:44.903 --> 31:46.655
Ah, fine. The same.

31:46.822 --> 31:48.532
You know how it is.

31:48.699 --> 31:51.367
My sister
and Kyle are buying
their house.

31:51.368 --> 31:52.369
Mm.

31:52.578 --> 31:54.037
One second!

31:54.038 --> 31:55.956
Um, well, how's Luke?

31:56.123 --> 31:57.166
Oh, he's fine.

31:59.627 --> 32:01.086
Is Hunter there?

32:02.421 --> 32:04.256
He is.

32:05.174 --> 32:06.592
What?

32:07.343 --> 32:09.053
Um, I don't know.

32:09.219 --> 32:11.180
I don't know if I
should tell you or not.

32:12.097 --> 32:13.306
Tell me what?

32:13.307 --> 32:14.600
Now you have to tell me.

32:16.894 --> 32:19.938
He just-- he's here
with a girl.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.276
Hunter's there with a girl?

32:24.443 --> 32:25.819
Yeah, I mean,
I don't think it's serious

32:25.944 --> 32:28.113
or anything, but-- One second!

32:28.280 --> 32:31.324
Well, did you say anything
to him or...

32:31.325 --> 32:32.576
Like what?

32:33.786 --> 32:36.747
Like, I don't know,
"That was a little fast" or...

32:38.290 --> 32:39.248
I'm sure it's just a rebound,
Gem.

32:39.249 --> 32:41.001
He's just trying
to get over you.

32:42.419 --> 32:44.337
Jesus Christ, oh,
my God, Gemma.

32:44.338 --> 32:45.255
This guy won't leave me alone.

32:45.422 --> 32:46.422
Can I call you back? I'm sorry.

32:46.423 --> 32:48.383
Uh, yeah, yeah, that's fine.
I'm fine. Yeah.

32:48.384 --> 32:49.384
Okay, I'm sorry.

32:49.385 --> 32:50.969
- I promise I'll call you back.
- Okay.

32:51.136 --> 32:52.011
Okay. Bye.

32:52.012 --> 32:52.930
Bye!

33:04.733 --> 33:05.651
- Oh!
- Yeah.

33:05.859 --> 33:07.236
Wait, who's having the wedding?

33:07.361 --> 33:08.612
It's, um, my friend Hannah.

33:08.779 --> 33:10.446
Her-- her little sister
is getting married.

33:10.447 --> 33:11.364
Her little sister?

33:11.365 --> 33:12.907
- Yeah.
- Oh!

33:13.826 --> 33:15.368
That's so nice,
I just love weddings.

33:15.369 --> 33:16.912
She already has
my dress picked out.

33:17.621 --> 33:18.539
It's Saturday?

33:18.831 --> 33:19.789
- Mm-hmm.
- You both going?

33:19.790 --> 33:21.583
- Mm-hmm.
- Aw...

33:21.750 --> 33:23.627
Gemma, just make sure
you catch the bouquet.

33:23.794 --> 33:24.795
- Okay.
- Mom.

33:24.962 --> 33:25.921
Yeah.

33:34.847 --> 33:36.473
No, no!

33:36.598 --> 33:38.600
Wait, let me see your armpits.

33:38.767 --> 33:40.393
How do I get inside your head?

33:40.394 --> 33:42.312
What do you-- ah!

33:43.480 --> 33:44.690
What do you wanna know?

33:49.486 --> 33:50.988
Will you love me forever?

33:56.326 --> 33:57.244
I hope so.

34:35.407 --> 34:36.491
- Gemma!
- Hey!

34:36.492 --> 34:37.951
Thanks for picking me up.

34:43.123 --> 34:44.875
Isn't this incredible?

34:45.042 --> 34:46.168
It's beautiful.

34:52.049 --> 34:54.176
I used to come out here
just to clear my head.

35:02.392 --> 35:03.227
Here.

35:08.065 --> 35:11.443
So, um, you settled in?

35:13.445 --> 35:14.655
Have any auditions?

35:15.572 --> 35:16.865
Ugh, I...

35:17.032 --> 35:19.034
I had one,
but I haven't heard back.

35:21.328 --> 35:22.788
It'll come when
you don't need it.

35:23.705 --> 35:25.582
It's just... it's so scary, though.

35:25.749 --> 35:30.087
Like, what if I was
actually wrong this whole time

35:30.254 --> 35:32.422
and I actually
can't make it there?

35:32.589 --> 35:33.882
Make it where?

35:34.049 --> 35:35.717
To where I
always thought I'd be.

35:35.884 --> 35:36.760
Well, you'll never
make it there,

35:36.927 --> 35:38.428
so you might
as well stop tryin'.

35:41.598 --> 35:44.309
And everyone back home
is just tryin' to find

35:44.476 --> 35:46.854
a comfortable spot
to wait out their lives.

35:48.897 --> 35:51.358
And I know they all think
that I'm gonna fail at this.

35:53.610 --> 35:54.903
But I just couldn't stay there.

35:56.363 --> 35:57.865
I couldn't do it.

35:58.031 --> 36:00.951
You have the pull,
call to the Unknown.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.204
All the best ones have it.

36:08.125 --> 36:10.585
Look, if an audition comes up,

36:10.586 --> 36:14.298
something that you're right
for, I'll-- I'll let you know.

36:14.464 --> 36:16.758
I have these things come
across my desk all the time.

36:17.634 --> 36:18.927
You will?

36:19.094 --> 36:20.387
You got somethin', Gemma.

36:22.472 --> 36:26.184
I'm not sure what,
but there's somethin' there.

36:30.230 --> 36:31.982
...have been made in connection
to a series

36:32.149 --> 36:34.985
of convenience store robberies
that stretched across

36:35.152 --> 36:36.695
Los Angeles and Orange County
over the last few weeks.

36:36.862 --> 36:38.155
Oh, my God.

36:39.615 --> 36:41.574
These arrests came after police
pursued a vehicle

36:41.575 --> 36:42.743
matching one recorded

36:42.910 --> 36:46.038
on a convenience store's
CCTV camera.

36:46.204 --> 36:49.416
Three suspects have been taken
into custody for the robberies.

38:56.793 --> 38:58.295
Hello, beautiful.

38:58.462 --> 39:00.922
I wanna welcome you
to the night of your dreams.

39:01.089 --> 39:03.216
Now let me tell you
how this is gonna work.

39:03.383 --> 39:04.926
Room nine!

39:05.093 --> 39:06.719
- Where are you taking me?
- Down the hallway to the right.

39:06.720 --> 39:07.720
Where are you taking me?

39:07.721 --> 39:09.764
I can't take this anymore!

39:09.765 --> 39:12.434
Please just let me go!

39:14.478 --> 39:17.564
You all stay here.

39:17.731 --> 39:20.233
Um, what was that?

39:20.400 --> 39:22.735
Cloud Nine, first of the year.

39:22.736 --> 39:23.820
What's Cloud Nine?

39:23.987 --> 39:25.572
It's an emergency procedure.

39:25.739 --> 39:26.573
More like experiment.

39:26.740 --> 39:28.658
For those who, because
of severe mental illness,

39:28.825 --> 39:30.743
pose an immediate threat
to themselves or others.

39:30.744 --> 39:32.828
But what--
what's happening to her?

39:32.829 --> 39:34.247
What's the procedure?

39:34.539 --> 39:36.248
Pretty much the same thing as
we do for our regular clients.

39:36.249 --> 39:38.877
Only the duration is nine hours
instead of six weeks.

39:39.044 --> 39:41.505
She's given a cocktail of DMT
and MAOIs,

39:41.671 --> 39:44.174
and she has virtually no say
in what reality we put her in.

39:44.341 --> 39:45.884
They're asked the exact
same questions, Olivia.

39:46.051 --> 39:48.512
They aren't lucid, they're sick.

39:48.678 --> 39:50.263
The normal procedure
makes clients believe

39:50.430 --> 39:52.015
that their dreams are possible.

39:52.182 --> 39:54.059
Cloud Nine makes them believe
that they already happened.

39:54.226 --> 39:56.186
We've had success
with Cloud Nine

39:56.353 --> 39:57.938
where other treatments
didn't work.

39:58.855 --> 39:59.898
Patient 221.

40:00.065 --> 40:00.898
Yeah, okay.

40:00.899 --> 40:03.442
Tell her what happened with 221.

40:03.443 --> 40:06.238
I mean, Doctor Shaffer, she
knows what she's doing, right?

40:06.404 --> 40:08.073
We all know
what we're doing is--

40:08.240 --> 40:09.824
Nobody knows what they're doing.

40:09.825 --> 40:11.618
These people are delusional.

40:11.785 --> 40:12.744
They're hopeless.

40:12.869 --> 40:14.787
I mean, isn't anything better
than whatever reality

40:14.788 --> 40:15.872
they're stuck in now?

40:16.039 --> 40:17.332
Then get them here,

40:17.499 --> 40:20.085
not in some new episode
of insanity.

40:20.252 --> 40:22.795
What happens in the cloud
is irreversible.

40:22.796 --> 40:24.589
It's an entire system reboot.

40:25.882 --> 40:27.217
No one comes back the same.

41:09.926 --> 41:10.886
What?

41:17.726 --> 41:20.896
Do you ever grieve
for lives you don't get to live?

41:22.939 --> 41:27.944
Like, you look at your life,
and you can sort of predict

41:28.820 --> 41:30.739
how each different path
that you could take

41:30.906 --> 41:32.908
and unfold, you know?

41:35.368 --> 41:38.205
And you can guess how each
version of yourself would--

41:39.831 --> 41:40.749
Would be.

41:44.294 --> 41:45.879
But you never know for sure.

41:50.967 --> 41:52.052
Makes me sad.

41:54.846 --> 41:56.723
Not so much for what I'm leaving
behind me

41:56.890 --> 41:57.974
but more for...

41:59.267 --> 42:03.772
the path that's just right
beside mine, you know?

42:03.939 --> 42:06.024
Like, I can see it or sense it.

42:07.400 --> 42:08.985
All the things
I won't get to do,

42:09.110 --> 42:10.153
and the people I won't meet,

42:10.320 --> 42:13.240
and the experiences
I'll never have.

42:21.164 --> 42:22.749
Does that make sense?

42:24.125 --> 42:25.001
Yeah.

45:04.744 --> 45:05.662
Hello?

45:17.966 --> 45:18.800
Gemma!

45:19.801 --> 45:21.010
Noah!

45:21.177 --> 45:22.720
Uh, I thought you
were on break.

45:22.887 --> 45:25.180
Are you-- you're
working in room nine?

45:25.181 --> 45:28.100
You know what, I'm actually glad
I ran into you.

45:28.101 --> 45:29.519
I've been meaning to ask

45:31.104 --> 45:32.689
did you touch my camera?

45:34.274 --> 45:35.400
No.

45:36.609 --> 45:38.278
Wait, is this gonna hurt?

45:39.237 --> 45:41.364
Uh, you can head home
for the night.

45:42.198 --> 45:43.741
I've got everything
taken care of.

45:44.409 --> 45:46.118
Final week next week.

45:46.119 --> 45:48.163
Make sure you get some rest
while you still can.

45:55.086 --> 45:56.628
So, how'd you come up
with the name Max?

45:56.629 --> 45:58.130
Because that wasn't
your given name, right?

45:58.131 --> 45:59.591
Your given name was Martha.

45:59.757 --> 46:01.885
I'd tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

46:02.051 --> 46:04.012
No, I'd tell you,
but it's just legally

46:04.179 --> 46:05.137
I'm not allowed to say.

46:05.138 --> 46:06.138
Really?

46:06.139 --> 46:07.181
Brooks!

46:07.182 --> 46:08.850
Gemma, hey.

46:08.975 --> 46:10.226
I don't know what you're doin'
this Friday,

46:10.393 --> 46:13.145
but there's a party
in the hills
and a bunch of us are going

46:13.146 --> 46:14.522
if you wanna come.

46:14.814 --> 46:18.692
Oh, shit, um, I wish I could,
but I-- I work this Friday.

46:18.693 --> 46:20.945
Brooks, are you coming
in this car?

46:21.112 --> 46:23.031
Wait, look, the kid who owns
the place is a director.

46:23.198 --> 46:24.616
I think it'll be good for you.

46:24.782 --> 46:25.783
Look, I gotta run
but, you know,

46:25.950 --> 46:27.243
shoot me a text
if you can make it.

46:27.410 --> 46:28.244
Okay, thanks.

46:30.163 --> 46:31.079
...yourself from
three years ago

46:31.080 --> 46:32.123
think of where you are now?

46:32.248 --> 46:34.626
I don't really think about
my life before Max.

46:34.792 --> 46:36.294
It's all been such a blur,
you know?

46:37.462 --> 46:39.171
Hey, I'm sorry to bother you.

46:39.172 --> 46:40.381
I just...

46:40.548 --> 46:42.257
I had this really big
opportunity pop up

46:42.258 --> 46:43.384
this Friday night,

46:43.551 --> 46:45.261
and I was wondering
if there was any way

46:45.428 --> 46:47.430
that you could cover my shift?

46:48.806 --> 46:49.640
I'm already staying late
this week

46:49.641 --> 46:50.683
to pull off this cycle,

46:50.850 --> 46:52.352
And now, with the Cloud Nine,

46:52.519 --> 46:55.021
you don't know the kind of shit
I'm dealing with.

46:55.188 --> 46:57.857
Well, do you think it'd be okay
if I slipped out

46:58.024 --> 46:59.442
for just, like, an hour?

47:00.360 --> 47:01.193
Gemma.

47:01.194 --> 47:02.194
Just an hour.

47:02.195 --> 47:05.156
They all just lay there anyway,
nothing ever happens.

47:05.281 --> 47:07.283
It's the last weekend
of the cycle, Gemma.

47:07.408 --> 47:09.661
If Doctor Shaffer
checks the security system

47:09.827 --> 47:11.703
and sees you just walk out
while everyone is asleep,

47:11.704 --> 47:12.621
you'll be fired.

47:12.622 --> 47:15.207
No, I know, I know,
I-- I wouldn't.

47:15.208 --> 47:17.209
I just...

47:17.210 --> 47:19.211
Sorry, Olivia, I...

47:19.212 --> 47:20.295
Have a good night.

47:20.296 --> 47:21.213
Okay.

47:21.214 --> 47:23.215
Uh, you, too.

47:23.216 --> 47:24.509
Shit.

47:34.143 --> 47:36.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:36.187 --> 47:39.065
Check, check, check,
hello, hello, hello, hello.

47:40.316 --> 47:42.110
Check, yeah, yeah, two, two--

47:42.277 --> 47:44.236
I'll take just a
little bit more
if I can, man.

47:51.703 --> 47:53.371
Wait, dude, come on, I didn't--

47:53.538 --> 47:54.371
Gemma, what'd you say
to those guys?

47:54.372 --> 47:55.581
I just-- nothin', I just--

47:55.582 --> 47:56.498
Please just tell me exactly
what you said.

47:56.499 --> 47:57.667
Okay, I just...

47:57.834 --> 48:00.252
I said that you're a really
big fan of theirs.

48:01.337 --> 48:03.338
And I was-- and I asked them

48:03.339 --> 48:04.591
if they were lookin'
for another band mate.

48:04.757 --> 48:05.757
It wasn't a big deal,
it was just--

48:05.758 --> 48:07.552
Oh, my God,
what are you thinking?

48:08.720 --> 48:10.262
I'm a sound tech.
Do you get what that means?

48:10.263 --> 48:12.306
Those guys are, like, one
of my favorite bands, okay.

48:12.307 --> 48:13.808
So saying that--
it's humiliating,

48:13.975 --> 48:16.227
it's unprofessional,
and it's a complete disrespect

48:16.352 --> 48:17.604
to them as artists.

48:17.770 --> 48:19.897
But, Hunter, you--
you say artists like you

48:20.064 --> 48:21.106
aren't one of them.

48:21.107 --> 48:23.026
What?
No, you're missing the point.

48:23.943 --> 48:25.277
- What-- you-- you have all--
- What?

48:25.278 --> 48:26.278
You have all these songs
and you just--

48:26.279 --> 48:27.905
You never play and I--

48:28.072 --> 48:28.906
I was just trying to help
because I--

48:29.157 --> 48:30.574
Okay, yeah,
but that's not a help.

48:30.575 --> 48:32.368
It's not a help.

48:32.493 --> 48:33.911
- Alright? You're-- oh!
- Alright, what?

48:34.078 --> 48:35.287
So, you're just-- you're gonna
stay here

48:35.288 --> 48:36.956
and you're just gonna work
at your dad's shop forever?

48:37.123 --> 48:38.374
Alright, alright.
That's what this is about.

48:38.541 --> 48:40.084
Okay, great, good, good.

48:40.251 --> 48:41.961
You know what, stop trying to
make me into someone I'm not.

48:42.128 --> 48:42.962
Okay?

48:43.087 --> 48:44.922
Look, I can't do this
with you right now.

48:45.089 --> 48:46.298
Like, I gotta get back in there.
Just--

48:46.299 --> 48:48.300
Okay, I'm sorry.
No, Hunter, I didn't mean--

48:48.301 --> 48:49.636
Just-- please, you should go.

48:52.305 --> 48:54.223
We know you have big dreams.

48:54.390 --> 48:58.269
At Somnium, those dreams
can become your reality.

48:58.394 --> 48:59.687
Our team of professionals

48:59.854 --> 49:02.522
develop a six-week
integration program

49:02.523 --> 49:03.649
customized to you--

49:05.276 --> 49:06.444
And your unique dreams.
Using Somnium's--

49:06.611 --> 49:08.279
Cool, I'm all set.

49:08.404 --> 49:10.990
Readings have been sent,
and everyone's in for the night.

49:11.157 --> 49:13.076
Sounds good. I'll be here.

49:14.369 --> 49:15.411
...ultimately manifesting...

49:15.536 --> 49:16.621
Okay.

49:17.580 --> 49:19.540
Well, enjoy your night
with the zombies.

49:19.707 --> 49:20.917
Thank you.

49:33.346 --> 49:35.014
Okay, go to maintain.

49:36.140 --> 49:37.100
Okay, so I can...

49:44.482 --> 49:45.441
Backup log?

49:53.032 --> 49:53.865
What?

49:57.370 --> 49:58.454
Hop on up here.

50:05.545 --> 50:06.838
Hello?

50:09.799 --> 50:10.675
Gemma!

50:10.925 --> 50:12.008
Noah!

50:12.009 --> 50:13.678
Uh, I thought you were on break.

50:17.306 --> 50:18.390
What is he doing?

50:18.391 --> 50:19.391
Relax.

50:22.395 --> 50:23.479
I said, relax.

50:27.650 --> 50:28.901
How many...

50:31.821 --> 50:33.488
Why are you doing this to me?

51:49.273 --> 51:50.149
Get in here.

51:50.316 --> 51:51.566
Hey.

51:51.567 --> 51:52.944
I'm so happy you can make it.

51:53.110 --> 51:55.404
Oh, I can't stay
for very long, though.

51:55.571 --> 51:57.907
This is Dakota and Cate.

51:58.074 --> 52:00.034
Cate's an incredible singer
out of Brooklyn

52:00.201 --> 52:02.787
and Dakota is an aspiring
actress such as yourself.

52:02.954 --> 52:03.788
Hi.

52:03.996 --> 52:05.706
She just tested
for a pilot today.

52:06.582 --> 52:08.000
I like your shoes.

52:08.167 --> 52:09.043
Thank you.

52:09.669 --> 52:10.502
And this is...

52:10.503 --> 52:12.213
They call me Cowboy.

52:12.380 --> 52:13.422
Howdy.

52:29.355 --> 52:30.815
What's up!

52:31.941 --> 52:33.484
Welcome to the future.

52:53.796 --> 52:55.298
Hunter?

53:06.809 --> 53:07.935
Hey!

53:09.270 --> 53:10.104
Hey.

53:10.229 --> 53:11.605
You taking a breather, too?

53:11.606 --> 53:14.066
Um, something like that.

53:15.443 --> 53:19.155
Um, Brooks said in the limo that
you just tested for a pilot?

53:19.322 --> 53:20.239
That's so cool.

53:20.406 --> 53:21.615
I didn't get it.

53:21.616 --> 53:23.575
I just got the text.

53:23.576 --> 53:26.078
Oh, um, I'm sorry.

53:27.663 --> 53:29.707
It was my fourth test this year.

53:31.417 --> 53:34.545
And for everyone, it's me
against one other girl.

53:35.630 --> 53:37.882
It's like someone's
playing some sick joke.

53:38.049 --> 53:40.384
But you're so close.

53:40.551 --> 53:42.303
I mean, you're in the room.

53:42.470 --> 53:43.512
Close means nothing.

53:45.014 --> 53:47.599
Close means just
shy of good enough.

53:47.600 --> 53:48.558
Well, I'm...

53:48.559 --> 53:50.811
I'm sure that
you'll book something soon.

53:50.978 --> 53:53.230
I've been at this for 15 years,
Gemma.

53:55.024 --> 53:56.484
I don't even know
what a normal life is like

53:56.651 --> 53:57.902
outside of this anymore.

53:59.695 --> 54:00.863
I don't think
I can do it anymore.

54:01.030 --> 54:03.199
Hey, don't-- don't say that.

54:03.991 --> 54:05.701
Do you wanna, um,

54:05.826 --> 54:07.244
do you want to just go back
to the party?

54:07.411 --> 54:08.537
We can have fun.

54:08.704 --> 54:10.289
You go.

54:10.456 --> 54:11.791
I'll be out in a minute.

54:11.958 --> 54:13.501
Are you sure?
I can wait with you if you want.

54:13.668 --> 54:14.794
I'll be down in a minute.

54:16.295 --> 54:18.005
Okay, alright.

54:30.935 --> 54:32.644
I lost you in there.

54:32.645 --> 54:35.731
Um, I should probably be
getting back to the clinic.

54:35.856 --> 54:37.024
Are you okay?

54:37.191 --> 54:38.609
Cold?

54:38.734 --> 54:39.694
A little.

54:40.736 --> 54:41.737
Here.

54:42.738 --> 54:44.656
- You having fun?
- Yeah.

54:44.657 --> 54:46.367
Are you meeting people?

54:46.534 --> 54:48.786
Um, kind of, yeah.

54:48.953 --> 54:50.537
Did you see Max over there?

54:50.538 --> 54:51.454
No.

54:51.455 --> 54:52.498
She's over there.

54:52.790 --> 54:54.207
No, for real.
You-- you have to look cool.

54:54.208 --> 54:55.917
She wants to talk to you.

54:55.918 --> 54:56.835
She does?

54:56.836 --> 54:57.752
Mm-hmm.

54:57.753 --> 54:59.088
Go ahead.

54:59.839 --> 55:01.173
Go.

55:09.765 --> 55:11.350
Gemma!

55:11.517 --> 55:13.102
Hey.

55:13.269 --> 55:16.105
Cate tells me she picked
you up from Somnium today.

55:16.272 --> 55:18.315
W-- what were you doing there?

55:18.482 --> 55:20.568
Oh, that's--
that's just where I work.

55:21.777 --> 55:22.694
No shit.

55:22.695 --> 55:23.696
Dude.

55:24.780 --> 55:27.950
Okay, Gemma, that place
completely changed my life

55:28.117 --> 55:29.994
a few years back.

55:30.161 --> 55:31.579
Like, day and night.

55:31.746 --> 55:33.998
She was a completely
different person before.

55:34.165 --> 55:35.707
- Really?
- Yeah.

55:35.708 --> 55:37.543
I mean, I didn't go by choice.

55:37.710 --> 55:39.003
You know what I mean?

55:39.170 --> 55:41.088
But, like, it's where
I had my rebirth.

55:42.048 --> 55:44.050
And look, no one knows this
but us three.

55:45.509 --> 55:46.427
Check this out.

55:47.803 --> 55:49.722
They said I was number 221.

55:50.973 --> 55:52.808
I went into a coma
and I almost died in there.

55:53.851 --> 55:57.396
They were ready to pull the plug
and then one day I woke up

55:57.563 --> 56:00.399
and I was Max.

56:03.652 --> 56:04.904
Alright.

56:05.071 --> 56:06.113
Have a good night.

56:06.280 --> 56:07.490
She got here.

56:08.824 --> 56:10.076
Mm-hmm.

56:11.118 --> 56:12.744
Yeah, she's pissed.

56:12.745 --> 56:15.747
And I know this firing,
rehiring,

56:15.748 --> 56:16.874
it is taking it out of her.

56:29.595 --> 56:31.013
What?

56:31.180 --> 56:32.723
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

56:32.848 --> 56:34.850
No, no, three days?

56:37.645 --> 56:38.938
What?

56:46.403 --> 56:47.863
Okay.

56:48.030 --> 56:49.240
Think, Gemma.

56:50.449 --> 56:51.534
Just think.

59:31.402 --> 59:32.778
- Hey, hey.
- There she is.

59:32.945 --> 59:34.154
Come in, come in.

59:35.030 --> 59:35.990
Hey, I can't stay long.

59:36.115 --> 59:37.532
I-- I got a meeting
in Hollywood.

59:37.533 --> 59:40.952
I just-- I-- I thought
that you would, um,

59:40.953 --> 59:42.288
that you'd want your jacket
back.

59:43.205 --> 59:44.331
Here it is.

59:48.669 --> 59:50.671
Can I be straight with you?

59:50.838 --> 59:52.172
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

59:54.049 --> 59:55.134
I'm worried about you.

59:55.968 --> 59:57.511
Are you okay?

59:57.678 --> 59:58.554
Um...

59:59.305 --> 01:00:00.138
Yeah, I--

01:00:00.139 --> 01:00:01.764
Yeah, I mean, I've been...

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:03.975
I've been feeling,
like, little off lately,

01:00:03.976 --> 01:00:05.311
but I'm fine.

01:00:07.229 --> 01:00:09.063
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:00:09.064 --> 01:00:09.981
Yeah?

01:00:09.982 --> 01:00:11.317
Yeah.

01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:17.823
Okay.

01:00:19.241 --> 01:00:20.409
I'll give you a call.

01:00:22.036 --> 01:00:24.038
Well, wait, can't you just stay
for a bit?

01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:27.041
What's goin' on?

01:00:27.166 --> 01:00:28.500
Please, please
just stay for a bit.

01:00:28.667 --> 01:00:30.960
I just-- I just don't wanna be
alone with myself right now.

01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:32.629
Please.

01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:33.756
I just...

01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:37.551
I need-- I need a little help.

01:00:38.677 --> 01:00:40.596
- A little help?
- Yeah.

01:00:42.431 --> 01:00:44.933
'Cause you said-- you said
you were gonna help me.

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.394
You said you were gonna
help me get an audition, right?

01:00:47.561 --> 01:00:50.105
And then you said that you can
help me get on my feet, right?

01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:55.361
Remember?

01:00:56.362 --> 01:00:58.613
'Cause I--
I know that this looks bad.

01:00:58.614 --> 01:00:59.530
I know that.

01:00:59.531 --> 01:01:01.032
I just...

01:01:01.033 --> 01:01:02.368
I know that I can make it.

01:01:03.202 --> 01:01:04.912
I know I can.

01:01:05.079 --> 01:01:08.290
But-- but you were supposed
to tell me where to start.

01:01:11.919 --> 01:01:12.795
Wake up, Gemma.

01:01:14.129 --> 01:01:15.005
You're here.

01:01:16.048 --> 01:01:17.091
You're in it.

01:01:18.133 --> 01:01:19.593
There's no start.

01:01:21.136 --> 01:01:22.304
Listen to me.

01:01:23.305 --> 01:01:24.890
Are you listening?

01:01:25.057 --> 01:01:26.308
Yeah.

01:01:30.145 --> 01:01:31.563
No other moment

01:01:33.148 --> 01:01:35.901
but this one is real.

01:01:37.945 --> 01:01:40.406
Nothing else matters.

01:01:41.365 --> 01:01:43.575
Nothing else exists.

01:01:55.838 --> 01:01:56.713
But...

01:01:58.173 --> 01:02:00.175
but isn't that what you wanted?

01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:01.677
What I wanted?

01:02:04.179 --> 01:02:06.890
That's the difference
between you and me, darling.

01:02:08.517 --> 01:02:10.102
If it was what I wanted...

01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:13.897
I would have just reached out...

01:02:17.025 --> 01:02:18.318
and taken it.

01:02:21.447 --> 01:02:23.114
Wait, Brooks.

01:02:23.115 --> 01:02:25.242
Brooks. Please just--

01:02:25.409 --> 01:02:27.411
I told you that I saw
something in you,

01:02:28.579 --> 01:02:30.372
but I need you to see it
in yourself.

01:02:30.539 --> 01:02:32.416
But can you just-- just
tell me where to look?

01:02:32.583 --> 01:02:34.168
Please just tell me
where to look.

01:02:36.587 --> 01:02:39.214
Next time, you're face to face

01:02:39.339 --> 01:02:41.300
with whatever scares you
so much...

01:02:43.135 --> 01:02:44.428
you look it dead in the eye.

01:02:46.263 --> 01:02:47.639
There.

01:02:49.391 --> 01:02:50.642
That's where you start.

01:03:21.256 --> 01:03:23.717
You have one unheard message.

01:03:24.426 --> 01:03:25.343
With an iron. Yeah.

01:03:25.344 --> 01:03:26.469
Really?

01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:27.386
Yeah, that is the point.

01:03:29.223 --> 01:03:31.433
Someone told me before you even
that I look like

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:32.893
that dude Brandon.

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:34.185
I think you're calling someone.

01:03:34.186 --> 01:03:35.103
Oh, fuck.

01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:36.187
End of message.

01:03:38.857 --> 01:03:42.193
Gemma.

01:03:43.111 --> 01:03:44.195
Oh, leavin' already?

01:03:44.196 --> 01:03:45.906
Gemma, what the hell?

01:03:46.073 --> 01:03:47.366
Okay, well, you didn't have
to fucking come

01:03:47.533 --> 01:03:48.700
if you didn't wanna be here.

01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:50.201
Gemma.

01:03:52.287 --> 01:03:54.039
Seems like she was having fun.

01:04:03.382 --> 01:04:05.216
To two whole years together.

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:44.631
Are we gonna talk

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:46.508
or are we just gonna sit here
in silence?

01:04:49.344 --> 01:04:50.261
I don't know. I just--

01:04:50.262 --> 01:04:51.554
I can't fight with you anymore,
Gemma.

01:04:51.555 --> 01:04:52.556
I really don't have that in me.

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:54.098
Well, I don't wanna
fight anymore either.

01:04:54.099 --> 01:04:55.183
I'm sorry,

01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:57.436
but my world is kinda
fallin' apart on me right now

01:04:57.603 --> 01:04:59.270
and I-- I feel like I have
to chase you down

01:04:59.271 --> 01:05:00.271
to get a word in.

01:05:01.732 --> 01:05:03.190
I just don't think
I'm gonna be able to tell you

01:05:03.191 --> 01:05:04.234
what you wanna hear.

01:05:06.111 --> 01:05:09.906
Well, then just tell me
the truth.

01:05:13.368 --> 01:05:15.412
What you-- you're not sure
about LA?

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:20.083
Gemma, I never wanted to go
to LA.

01:05:23.337 --> 01:05:24.755
Well, then what? You wanna...

01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:28.299
Do you wanna see
other girls or--

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.301
No, God, it's not about that.

01:05:30.302 --> 01:05:31.887
I don't want to see other girls.

01:05:32.054 --> 01:05:33.388
I don't.

01:05:33.555 --> 01:05:36.099
I'd be single
if I weren't with you.

01:05:37.809 --> 01:05:39.393
Well, then what, you just
don't love me anymore?

01:05:39.394 --> 01:05:41.730
Oh, come on, don't say that.
It's not...

01:05:43.398 --> 01:05:44.733
Of course.

01:05:49.571 --> 01:05:51.073
This isn't what you want, Gemma.

01:05:51.239 --> 01:05:52.365
- How do you know what I want?
- I'm not what you want.

01:05:52.366 --> 01:05:54.409
- You don't know what I want.
- Yes, I know. Of course I do.

01:05:54.534 --> 01:05:55.786
I know you.

01:05:57.287 --> 01:05:58.497
I know you.

01:06:01.249 --> 01:06:02.250
- Shut up.
- I do.

01:06:04.878 --> 01:06:06.420
I mean, I remember that first
day we met

01:06:06.421 --> 01:06:07.422
and you were like,
"I want to be an actress.

01:06:07.547 --> 01:06:09.424
I'm gonna go to LA."

01:06:11.927 --> 01:06:13.178
You gotta
go follow your dreams.

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:15.931
I really can't be the guy
that's gonna keep you from that.

01:06:19.434 --> 01:06:22.229
There's nothing else here
for you, Gemma, except me.

01:06:27.442 --> 01:06:28.819
This is really what you want?

01:06:33.448 --> 01:06:35.158
Look me in the eye,
right now, Hunter.

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:36.785
And tell me...

01:06:36.952 --> 01:06:38.369
And tell me that this is it.

01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:12.070
I can't do this.

01:07:12.237 --> 01:07:13.280
I can't do this.

01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:21.246
I can't.

01:07:21.413 --> 01:07:22.413
I can't do this.

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:26.168
Okay.

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:43.685
You're running yourself
a plane ticket.

01:07:45.228 --> 01:07:46.313
Los Angeles.

01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:48.648
One way.

01:08:02.204 --> 01:08:03.413
Hello?

01:08:25.018 --> 01:08:26.770
What do you want from me?

01:08:42.911 --> 01:08:45.330
Just relax.

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:48.333
I'll come get you at nine

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:51.795
and you'll go home forgetting
this place ever existed.

01:08:54.923 --> 01:08:57.259
I thought it could've ended
differently for us.

01:08:59.594 --> 01:09:01.137
But I've got to give it to you.

01:09:02.138 --> 01:09:04.349
You figured it all out
a lot faster

01:09:04.516 --> 01:09:06.226
than the last sleep sitter.

01:09:10.564 --> 01:09:11.940
Sweet dreams, Gemma.

01:09:22.409 --> 01:09:26.788
Good evening and welcome
to Cloud Nine.

01:09:26.955 --> 01:09:29.374
We, at Somnium, have designed

01:09:29.541 --> 01:09:33.295
an accelerated dream program
just for you.

01:09:34.379 --> 01:09:39.175
Lie back,
relax into a sleeping position,

01:09:39.342 --> 01:09:44.472
and allow us to make
your wildest dreams

01:09:44.639 --> 01:09:46.141
come true.

01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:55.710
This is just a dream.

01:10:55.877 --> 01:10:57.628
Mm, no, no,
this is just a dream.

01:10:57.629 --> 01:10:59.339
This is just a dream, Gem.

01:11:48.763 --> 01:11:50.473
Where am I?

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:51.975
Where am I?

01:11:53.977 --> 01:11:55.603
No. Please, no.

01:12:01.109 --> 01:12:02.193
No, no, no, no, no.

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.070
No, no, no, no, no,
get me out of here!

01:12:04.237 --> 01:12:05.196
Noah!

01:12:05.363 --> 01:12:07.240
Noah, please!

01:12:07.407 --> 01:12:09.700
Please, get me
out of here, Noah!

01:12:37.812 --> 01:12:39.064
Gemma!

01:12:39.230 --> 01:12:40.523
Oh, thank God.

01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:41.524
There you are!

01:12:41.649 --> 01:12:42.483
Where were you?

01:12:42.484 --> 01:12:43.734
Come on, we gotta go!

01:12:43.735 --> 01:12:45.153
Okay. Right this way.

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:46.529
You found her?
Has she gone through wardrobe?

01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:47.571
Uh, no time for wardrobe.

01:12:47.572 --> 01:12:48.614
She looks great.

01:12:48.615 --> 01:12:49.741
I need you guys
in the wing, now.

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:51.075
Yeah, I got her now,
we're walkin' up.

01:12:51.076 --> 01:12:52.077
...this evening.

01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:53.577
You've seen her everywhere
this year,

01:12:53.578 --> 01:12:54.828
on film and TV,

01:12:54.829 --> 01:12:55.746
on billboards,
on magazine covers.

01:12:55.747 --> 01:12:57.999
Oh, hi, Gemma.
So nice to meet you.

01:12:58.166 --> 01:12:59.084
I'm such a fan.

01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:01.169
So, should we bring
her out now?

01:13:01.336 --> 01:13:02.170
You ready?

01:13:03.046 --> 01:13:04.297
Ready for what?

01:13:04.464 --> 01:13:05.381
Showtime.

01:13:07.967 --> 01:13:10.512
Alright, well, let's give her
a warm welcome, everyone.

01:13:10.678 --> 01:13:12.763
Gemma Solomon!

01:13:29.864 --> 01:13:30.865
Hi!

01:13:32.158 --> 01:13:33.868
This is the first time
we're meeting.

01:13:34.035 --> 01:13:36.037
Um, thank you so much, Gemma,
for taking time out

01:13:36.204 --> 01:13:37.247
of your busy schedule
to join us.

01:13:38.832 --> 01:13:40.499
So, this has been a real
whirlwind year for you, right?

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:43.253
With back-to-back
box office hits

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:46.881
and a starring role in the most
anticipated television series.

01:13:47.048 --> 01:13:47.924
So, you got to tell us--

01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:52.053
Did you always know
you'd make it here?

01:13:53.888 --> 01:13:55.682
Oh, um...

01:13:55.849 --> 01:13:57.142
I'm sorry, I don't--

01:13:59.144 --> 01:14:00.687
I don't really know
where I am right now.

01:14:01.813 --> 01:14:03.523
Um...

01:14:03.690 --> 01:14:06.776
This is happening.
This, um, this is-- this is--

01:14:06.901 --> 01:14:07.902
This is really--
this is happening?

01:14:10.405 --> 01:14:12.907
Okay, let's-- let's be honest.

01:14:13.032 --> 01:14:15.535
You're America's sweetheart.
Right?

01:14:15.702 --> 01:14:18.787
Small-town girl with big dreams
who makes it all the way.

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:20.206
You're an inspiration.

01:14:20.498 --> 01:14:22.291
What piece of advice would you
give to someone like yourself

01:14:22.292 --> 01:14:24.127
who's out there
watching right now?

01:14:27.589 --> 01:14:29.424
I don't really know what to say
because...

01:14:31.217 --> 01:14:33.845
...the door was just open
and that's how I got here.

01:14:35.847 --> 01:14:37.223
I just ended up here.

01:14:39.934 --> 01:14:41.227
Oh.

01:14:41.394 --> 01:14:44.022
Okay, tell us, um, tell us
about some of the people

01:14:44.189 --> 01:14:45.940
who inspired you along the way.

01:14:46.065 --> 01:14:47.192
You've come so far.

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.736
There must be so many people
that inspired you!

01:14:50.778 --> 01:14:51.905
Um...

01:14:53.948 --> 01:14:55.200
I...

01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:57.327
I don't really have anybody.

01:14:58.661 --> 01:15:00.580
I mean, I--
I had my friends back home,

01:15:01.456 --> 01:15:03.750
like Hannah and Luke, but...

01:15:05.418 --> 01:15:06.669
But they didn't really think
that I was--

01:15:06.836 --> 01:15:07.921
I was gonna make it.

01:15:09.964 --> 01:15:11.633
And then my parents,

01:15:11.799 --> 01:15:12.967
they probably would have
been happier

01:15:13.259 --> 01:15:17.555
if I'd just stayed home
and taken over the family diner.

01:15:18.348 --> 01:15:19.599
There's no one at all?

01:15:20.975 --> 01:15:22.559
I mean, I'm sure there mu--

01:15:23.478 --> 01:15:24.771
What-- what do I do with this?

01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:29.900
Um, I'm sorry.

01:15:29.901 --> 01:15:31.402
I'm sorry,
'cause I shouldn't--

01:15:31.569 --> 01:15:34.280
Um, I shouldn't be here
'cause...

01:15:34.447 --> 01:15:36.949
I'm not ready for this.
I'm so-- I'm so sorry. Sorry!

01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:38.451
I d-- I-- I'm gonna go.

01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:42.497
What?

01:15:43.748 --> 01:15:45.916
Gemma? Wait!

01:15:45.917 --> 01:15:47.543
- Gemma, come back!
- Oh, no.

01:16:12.944 --> 01:16:14.945
Okay, okay, okay.

01:16:14.946 --> 01:16:16.906
Think, think, think, Gemma.

01:16:17.031 --> 01:16:18.032
This is a dream.

01:16:18.199 --> 01:16:19.242
This-- this is a dream.

01:16:19.409 --> 01:16:20.618
And if it's a dream...

01:16:20.785 --> 01:16:23.036
If it's a dream,
you can wake yourself up, okay?

01:16:23.037 --> 01:16:24.497
Wake yourself up.
Wake yourself up!

01:16:24.664 --> 01:16:26.040
Come on, come on, come on,
come on.

01:16:26.207 --> 01:16:28.543
Please, wake up!

01:16:28.710 --> 01:16:30.211
Wake up.
Wake up.

01:16:30.378 --> 01:16:32.004
Wake up, wake up!

01:16:32.005 --> 01:16:33.381
Wake up!

01:16:35.091 --> 01:16:37.176
Please, Noah,
please let me out!

01:16:37.343 --> 01:16:39.429
I won't-- I won't
tell anyone, I swear.

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:42.347
I'm-- I'll leave and I'll--
I'll disappear forever.

01:16:42.348 --> 01:16:43.265
Please!

01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:03.911
The diner?

01:17:37.111 --> 01:17:38.488
Gemma.

01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:49.957
Hunter?

01:17:54.045 --> 01:17:55.671
You came back.

01:18:02.136 --> 01:18:03.554
I've been waiting here for you.

01:18:05.890 --> 01:18:07.725
Everything can go
back to the way it was.

01:18:08.893 --> 01:18:10.061
Don't you remember?

01:18:16.275 --> 01:18:17.777
I remember.

01:18:17.944 --> 01:18:19.529
Of course I do.

01:18:21.239 --> 01:18:22.407
Good.

01:18:23.324 --> 01:18:25.827
Then stay this time.

01:18:25.993 --> 01:18:27.954
I can really stay?

01:18:28.121 --> 01:18:29.831
Yes, of course you can.

01:18:32.917 --> 01:18:34.084
Wait.

01:18:34.085 --> 01:18:35.002
But...

01:18:35.128 --> 01:18:36.170
But what?

01:18:37.964 --> 01:18:39.006
You could change your mind.

01:18:39.173 --> 01:18:40.466
What do you think
you're gonna do?

01:18:41.384 --> 01:18:45.763
Gemma, you lost your job.

01:18:45.930 --> 01:18:48.474
You're getting kicked out
of your apartment.

01:18:48.641 --> 01:18:49.975
I hate to break it to you,
but your old friends

01:18:49.976 --> 01:18:50.976
have all moved on,

01:18:50.977 --> 01:18:52.186
and we all know
you can't make new ones.

01:18:52.311 --> 01:18:54.564
No, Hunter, stop. Please.

01:18:55.523 --> 01:18:57.608
How long have you been in LA?

01:19:00.194 --> 01:19:01.571
And you've made it...

01:19:03.865 --> 01:19:05.032
...nowhere.

01:19:06.742 --> 01:19:10.288
Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.

01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:12.915
You failed.

01:19:14.208 --> 01:19:16.168
Face it, Gemma,
you're not enough

01:19:16.169 --> 01:19:17.587
and you never will be.

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:20.465
No. Stop, Hunter.
That isn't true.

01:19:20.631 --> 01:19:23.217
Just stay here with me
where you're safe

01:19:23.384 --> 01:19:25.011
and you
don't have to be afraid.

01:19:28.097 --> 01:19:29.265
Or what?

01:19:30.808 --> 01:19:32.310
You wanna...

01:19:48.201 --> 01:19:52.246
You wanna leave us all
and go live your dream life?

01:19:57.001 --> 01:19:58.628
How would you know that?

01:20:02.757 --> 01:20:04.926
Remember that boy, Hunter?

01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:07.470
I think we really tried.

01:20:08.846 --> 01:20:10.348
Will you love me forever?

01:20:11.599 --> 01:20:14.810
Do you ever grieve for lives
you don't get to live?

01:20:14.977 --> 01:20:16.479
Everyone misses you, Gemma.

01:20:16.646 --> 01:20:18.898
My parents told me
the house finally sold.

01:20:19.023 --> 01:20:19.856
I went to Luke's party
to tell Hunter.

01:20:19.857 --> 01:20:20.941
Seems like she was having fun.

01:20:20.942 --> 01:20:22.108
But he didn't wanna leave.

01:20:22.109 --> 01:20:23.193
I don't think I can
do it anymore.

01:20:23.194 --> 01:20:24.110
What do you do?

01:20:24.111 --> 01:20:25.196
Hannah's never
leaving this place.

01:20:25.363 --> 01:20:27.364
Is it naive to think
I could make it?

01:20:27.365 --> 01:20:29.199
You know what, stop tryin' to
make me into someone I'm not,

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:30.116
okay?

01:20:31.702 --> 01:20:32.619
I almost died in there.

01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:33.537
I'm just a nobody.

01:20:33.538 --> 01:20:34.538
Give up, Gemma.

01:20:34.539 --> 01:20:35.455
Who am I kidding? Give up.

01:20:35.456 --> 01:20:37.083
Just give up.

01:20:38.292 --> 01:20:40.293
Quiet!

01:20:51.514 --> 01:20:53.057
I loved you, Hunter.

01:20:53.224 --> 01:20:54.308
I-- I did.

01:20:56.018 --> 01:20:57.436
But you're not real.

01:21:00.731 --> 01:21:03.234
There's--
there's nothing left here.

01:21:04.777 --> 01:21:07.029
This is-- this is
where it ended.

01:21:12.201 --> 01:21:15.955
Who would I be to keep him
if he didn't wanna stay?

01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:19.625
That's not what love is.

01:21:21.419 --> 01:21:23.296
I know because he showed me.

01:21:29.343 --> 01:21:32.262
To love is... is to set free.

01:25:19.365 --> 01:25:20.241
Gemma?

01:25:35.047 --> 01:25:36.382
Gemma!

01:25:36.549 --> 01:25:38.217
How-- how you--

01:25:39.218 --> 01:25:40.219
H-- how did you...

01:25:44.974 --> 01:25:46.225
Gemma?

01:25:49.186 --> 01:25:50.020
What is this?

01:25:50.187 --> 01:25:51.229
...real waking life.

01:25:51.230 --> 01:25:53.983
There's a hard drive,
top right shelf.

01:25:54.984 --> 01:25:56.569
You should take a look.

01:26:25.973 --> 01:26:29.351
Breaking news, Los Angeles's
underground clinic Somnium,

01:26:29.518 --> 01:26:32.229
once rumored for making dreams
come true,

01:26:32.396 --> 01:26:35.565
closes today after 16 years
in operation.

01:26:35.566 --> 01:26:39.194
The closure comes just days
after a former Somnium
employee,

01:26:39.361 --> 01:26:42.531
Noah Wilkes, was arrested
and charged with kidnapping

01:26:42.656 --> 01:26:46.243
and aggravated assault after
a former co-worker came forward

01:26:46.410 --> 01:26:47.828
with video evidence.

01:26:58.297 --> 01:26:59.673
Hello?

01:26:59.798 --> 01:27:01.591
Hi, uh, I'm trying to
reach Gemma Solomon.

01:27:01.592 --> 01:27:02.927
This is she.

01:27:03.052 --> 01:27:03.885
Hi, Gemma.

01:27:03.886 --> 01:27:05.179
My name is Denise.

01:27:05.346 --> 01:27:06.764
Not sure
if you remember me,

01:27:06.931 --> 01:27:10.726
but I'm the casting director
for the film The Call.

01:27:10.893 --> 01:27:12.978
You read for the
part of Miranda
a few months ago,

01:27:13.145 --> 01:27:15.605
but unfortunately, we had some
permitting issues

01:27:15.606 --> 01:27:17.607
and ended up pushing the shoot.

01:27:17.608 --> 01:27:18.775
But I'm calling

01:27:18.776 --> 01:27:20.319
because we're finally
getting things moving again

01:27:20.486 --> 01:27:25.032
and we all, every one of us,
remembered your audition.

01:27:25.366 --> 01:27:28.202
I know it's been awhile
but if you're still interested,

01:27:28.369 --> 01:27:29.787
we'd like to offer
you the role.

01:27:32.581 --> 01:27:33.457
What do you think?

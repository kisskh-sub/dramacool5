00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.557
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.977
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:06.483
Major Crimes Investigation Unit
has arrived on the scene.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.277
Seo from Forensics
already started on-site inspection.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.988
Sealing the access road
to Nodu Stream Bank now.

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.324
CCTV footage from the area
has been secured.

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:16.576
Detective Kim.
The reporters are already here.

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.704
Sung-gyu, manage the reporters
and push back the police line.

00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:20.789
You got it.

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:23.666
Hyuk, just leave crowd control
at the entry point to the officers there,

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.001
and make your way here.

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:26.085
Yes, Detective Kim.

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:28.004
The reporters saw

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:30.799
the social media post
by the civilian who found the body,

00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:32.258
and scene control is difficult.

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:33.802
The police line has been set up.

00:01:34.677 --> 00:01:36.179
Fortunately, the scene is intact.

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:37.388
OCTOBER 12, 2025

00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:39.390
How much longer will you be, sir?

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:42.602
NODU STREAM BANK, NODU-DONG,
NAMSEUNG, JEOLLANAM PROVINCE

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:55.115
Excuse me.

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:59.119
The victim is Kim Hyeon-u, 43.

00:01:59.702 --> 00:02:02.455
Cause of death seems to be
asphyxiation due to strangulation.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.041
I thought he was found
without his phone or wallet.

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:06.459
How did you identify him?

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.629
He had an ankle monitor on.

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:12.507
Released eight months ago
after serving time for sexual assault.

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:17.804
Hey, this is a crime scene.
Go over there, at least.

00:02:18.513 --> 00:02:19.514
Hello, sir.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.061
Any irregularities?

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.689
Injection marks on his neck,
and his tongue has been cut off.

00:02:27.772 --> 00:02:29.732
We haven't found the tongue yet.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:32.235
I'll check body temperature
to estimate the time of death.

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:39.742
Hold on, Seo.

00:02:42.745 --> 00:02:43.746
First,

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:46.166
examine his lower body.

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:47.625
Yes, sir.

00:03:02.807 --> 00:03:04.809
Sir, we have extracted

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:06.352
the severed tongue from his backside.

00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:13.276
Sir.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.360
Could this be…

00:03:15.653 --> 00:03:16.529
Kim.

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:19.741
Focus on ensuring
strict scene security for now.

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:21.868
Yes, sir.

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:23.411
Please stay back.

00:03:25.496 --> 00:03:26.664
Please step back.

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:28.499
Stay behind the line.

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:30.126
Step back. This is a crime scene.

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:32.712
OCTOBER 15, 2001

00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:34.589
TANGWANG VILLAGE STREAM,
HYUPSEONG, WOONGSAN

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.098
Did you find anything?

00:03:44.682 --> 00:03:45.767
The forensics team

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:48.853
just extracted the victim's tongue
from his anus. That's all.

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:50.813
What did you just say?

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:51.856
His tongue?

00:03:56.194 --> 00:04:00.114
We've never handled
a murder case like this before.

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:03.201
This is your first as well, no?

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:04.786
Yes, sir.

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:06.287
What should we do?

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:13.503
A SHOCKING MURDER CASE
SEVERED TONGUE DISCOVERED IN ANUS

00:04:21.844 --> 00:04:24.722
A SECOND MURDER CASE IN WOONGSAN
PUBLIC FEAR GROWS OVER BRUTAL CRIME METHOD

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:48.496
CONDOLENCES

00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:50.290
THIRD BODY FOUND IN PUBLIC BATHHOUSE

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:52.417
WOONGSAN SERIAL HOMICIDE
INVESTIGATION HEADQUARTERS

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.336
We pledge to the public
that the culprit will be caught.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.462
They will be caught!

00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:01.175
The suspect in the brutal serial killings
throughout Woongsan and Yeonpo

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.554
since last fall has been arrested,
and is now being transported

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:06.306
to the special task force on this case.

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.100
It appears the public
has been referring to the suspect

00:05:09.183 --> 00:05:11.269
as the "Mantis."

00:05:11.352 --> 00:05:12.687
Can you tell us why that is?

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.647
It appears the term was adopted

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:17.775
after the suspect's victims were revealed
to be perpetrators in assaults

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:21.863
against their wives or other women,
or in child abuse allegations.

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:23.740
The female praying mantis
is commonly known

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:26.701
to be an insect that consumes
the male's head after mating.

00:05:26.784 --> 00:05:28.202
A prisoner van has just arrived!

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:29.787
There it is!

00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:30.955
Stay back.

00:05:40.381 --> 00:05:42.216
When did you start planning your crime?

00:05:42.884 --> 00:05:45.011
Do you admit to the serial killings?

00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:47.597
Any words for the bereaved?

00:05:48.222 --> 00:05:50.558
Do you admit to committing the murders?

00:05:50.641 --> 00:05:52.435
Sir, please give us a comment.

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:53.853
Do you admit to all the murders?

00:05:53.936 --> 00:05:57.231
-Sir!
-Do you admit to being the murderer?

00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:58.274
Why did you kill them?

00:05:58.357 --> 00:06:00.401
-Do you accept all charges?
-Well…

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:04.322
we have obtained a confession
from the suspect regarding the crime.

00:06:04.405 --> 00:06:06.032
We will hold an official press conference

00:06:06.115 --> 00:06:08.326
after completing a thorough investigation.

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:10.661
Do you have a statement
for the bereaved families?

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:12.330
Please maintain order.

00:06:12.413 --> 00:06:16.334
With the national celebration that is
the 2002 Korea-Japan World Cup coming up,

00:06:16.417 --> 00:06:18.336
this horrific crime will be…

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:29.055
NAMBU METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:30.640
Hyeon-u.

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.101
I see you were in Changyeon-dong.

00:06:34.435 --> 00:06:37.021
Who did you have that pork belly with?

00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:39.398
I will find out who you met,

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:42.693
and how you ended up
with a severed tongue, no matter what.

00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:45.113
-CCTV footage does not lie.
-Detective Kim,

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:47.323
why don't you just go
and take a quick nap?

00:06:47.406 --> 00:06:49.075
MANTIS CASE
WOONGHYEON STREAM, WOONGSAN

00:06:49.158 --> 00:06:51.285
MANTIS COPYCAT CRIME
NODU STREAM

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:53.663
It has already been days.

00:06:55.706 --> 00:06:57.458
Ms. Kim.

00:06:59.043 --> 00:07:00.920
Can't you see I'm trying to concentrate?

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.881
My love.

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:05.633
Give me strength.

00:07:08.886 --> 00:07:11.722
Seriously?
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:13.099
Yeah.

00:07:13.182 --> 00:07:14.308
Unbelievable.

00:07:17.478 --> 00:07:19.063
-Detective Kim!
-Hey, Kim!

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:20.314
-Detective Kim!
-Kim!

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:21.899
-Call for an ambulance now.
-Okay.

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:22.900
Kim!

00:07:23.609 --> 00:07:26.070
ANWON PRISON,
ANWON, GYEONGGI PROVINCE

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:28.990
…open to candid talks,

00:07:29.073 --> 00:07:30.950
and proposed a bipartisan leaders' meeting

00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:33.536
as soon as a clean bill of health
can be confirmed.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.289
Here is a recap of the body discovered

00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:38.875
on the bank of Nodu Stream
in Namseung last night.

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.794
A local resident, taking a walk
near the stream around 8:30 p.m,

00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:45.089
discovered the body
and reported it to the police.

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:47.967
The police arrived at the scene
and collected the body.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.471
They announced they will confirm
the cause of death after an autopsy.

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:54.307
Based on the evidence the body was moved

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.017
and mutilated,

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.060
they are considering
the likelihood of homicide.

00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:00.062
They have assured the public

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:02.023
that every effort
is being made to gather intel

00:08:02.106 --> 00:08:04.567
through local witness statements
and CCTV footage.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.861
Nambu Police Commissioner Hong Seung-pyo

00:08:06.944 --> 00:08:09.280
announced the victim's identity
was confirmed today,

00:08:09.363 --> 00:08:12.450
and that the investigation was focusing
on persons in his immediate circle.

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:20.958
DEAR DETECTIVE CHOI JUNG-HO
HAVE YOU BEEN WELL?

00:08:41.812 --> 00:08:42.813
You, go this way.

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:44.941
You, go that way.

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:56.702
Anyone home?

00:09:05.419 --> 00:09:06.462
Damn it.

00:09:09.423 --> 00:09:11.425
-Call for an ambulance.
-Yes, sir.

00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:14.095
Sir, I'm with the police.

00:09:14.178 --> 00:09:15.012
Can you see me?

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:17.181
-Can you hear me?
-A man has been stabbed…

00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:18.391
-Sir?
-I'll do it.

00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:20.393
The ambulance will be here soon.

00:09:20.476 --> 00:09:22.144
Your family is safe.

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:23.646
You will be fine as well, sir.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.691
We'll make sure
to catch whoever is responsible. Okay?

00:09:26.774 --> 00:09:28.651
You need to stay awake.
Who did this to you?

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:30.486
Do you remember who stabbed you?

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.324
Sir?

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:37.702
Yellow hat…

00:09:38.869 --> 00:09:40.121
Blue jacket…

00:09:40.204 --> 00:09:41.664
Yellow hat, blue jacket.

00:09:42.206 --> 00:09:43.207
Go!

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:44.667
Drug code two!

00:10:05.938 --> 00:10:08.107
Yellow hat, blue jacket.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.904
Ma'am.

00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:15.990
It's going to be okay.

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:17.992
The ambulance is coming.

00:10:18.075 --> 00:10:20.202
So just hang in there a little bit longer.

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:27.293
Mommy!

00:10:27.918 --> 00:10:30.671
Sir!

00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:34.300
Mommy!

00:10:34.383 --> 00:10:35.926
Mommy!

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:37.845
-Don't go, Mommy!
-No!

00:10:40.014 --> 00:10:42.600
Ma'am, please don't move.

00:10:42.683 --> 00:10:43.851
-Stay right there.
-Mommy!

00:10:43.934 --> 00:10:44.935
Hey, kiddo.

00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:47.146
It's dangerous over there.
Why don't you come to me?

00:10:47.229 --> 00:10:50.066
Ma'am, your husband has just passed away.

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:53.277
He's dead. And with his last breath…

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:58.032
he lied and said someone else stabbed him.

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:01.202
We can't let your child die as well.
Ma'am!

00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:02.953
Mommy!

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:08.084
Mommy!

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:09.627
Mommy!

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:11.087
Mommy!

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.505
Stop, Mommy!

00:11:12.588 --> 00:11:14.131
-Stop, Mommy!
-You damn brat!

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:15.925
Get away from me!

00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:17.968
There's a child. Are you insane?

00:11:18.052 --> 00:11:19.053
What's wrong with you?

00:11:31.315 --> 00:11:33.776
She says it was like
the lights suddenly went out.

00:11:33.859 --> 00:11:36.695
I haven't seen her go home
at all recently.

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:38.656
I hear you,

00:11:38.739 --> 00:11:40.658
but there won't be any backup for a while.

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:43.077
Come on, sir.

00:11:43.744 --> 00:11:45.371
We're barely hanging on right now.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.373
Just think about it.

00:11:47.456 --> 00:11:49.667
The squad leader spot
hasn't been filled yet.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.210
-Yeah.
-I think

00:11:51.293 --> 00:11:54.004
Detective Kim would be a perfect fit.

00:11:54.088 --> 00:11:55.756
-Detective Kim?
-Yes.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.508
She's basically leading the squad already.

00:11:57.591 --> 00:11:59.301
The team would be on board.

00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:02.304
If we could just get some backing
from the higher-ups, just this once,

00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:04.432
we promise we'll do our utmost best.

00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:05.683
Okay.

00:12:05.766 --> 00:12:07.309
We'll officially promote her soon.

00:12:08.727 --> 00:12:09.687
Thank you, sir.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:10.771
At your service!

00:12:13.732 --> 00:12:15.234
MANTIS CASE
MANTIS COPYCAT CRIME

00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:18.195
Thank you.

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:20.781
This is Choi Hyuk
from Major Crimes at Nambu Police.

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:23.075
Were you able to confirm it?

00:12:24.702 --> 00:12:26.370
So you didn't hear from Mr. Kim that day?

00:12:26.454 --> 00:12:28.205
FROM J
ANWON, GYEONGGI PROVINCE

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:31.208
Yes, I understand.
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:48.225
I mean, why did you shoot her?

00:12:49.393 --> 00:12:51.729
What if the kid got hurt?
Why did you shoot?

00:12:51.812 --> 00:12:53.856
If an officer shoots
a perfectly healthy kid dead,

00:12:53.939 --> 00:12:55.566
do you think it ends once they're fired?

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.319
Should I have stood by
while she killed that child?

00:12:58.402 --> 00:12:59.487
-Sir.
-What?

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.114
The mother's surgery went well
and she's stable now.

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:04.700
She's not her mother.

00:13:04.783 --> 00:13:06.035
What?

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:09.163
A woman who tries
to kill her own child is not a mother.

00:13:09.246 --> 00:13:11.415
And she deserves to die
because she's not a "mother"?

00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:13.125
Sir.

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:15.544
Please don't exaggerate. I shot her leg.

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:16.921
I stopped her.

00:13:17.004 --> 00:13:19.715
She was about to throw her child
off a four-story building.

00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:22.092
The kid almost died.

00:13:22.676 --> 00:13:23.677
I will gladly cooperate

00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:26.555
if there ever is
an official internal investigation. Happy?

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.390
You just won't quit, will you?

00:13:29.391 --> 00:13:30.518
I've told you over and over.

00:13:30.601 --> 00:13:34.021
We are not here to punish criminals.
We are here to stop crime.

00:13:34.104 --> 00:13:37.191
You should've looked for another way
before you shot your gun, you punk.

00:13:39.693 --> 00:13:40.945
What the?

00:13:41.028 --> 00:13:41.904
Hey.

00:13:43.405 --> 00:13:44.990
I won't just let it slide this time.

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:48.077
What's wrong with that punk?

00:13:48.827 --> 00:13:51.080
-Who's going to take her now?
-Who?

00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:52.414
The junkie's daughter.

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:54.917
They're reaching out
to Child Protective Services.

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:02.007
Then, who's going to take him?

00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:05.636
The husband skipped town
and is unreachable.

00:14:06.428 --> 00:14:09.139
Then, do we just
leave him there like that?

00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:15.980
You must be Jeong-ho.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:21.610
MANTIS, THE WOONGSAN SERIAL KILLER

00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:22.820
What a goddamn mess.

00:14:22.903 --> 00:14:24.488
I'm about to lose my mind over here.

00:14:25.364 --> 00:14:27.324
They're just conspiracy theories.

00:14:27.408 --> 00:14:28.534
The Mantis.

00:14:29.076 --> 00:14:30.744
Have you seen her since?

00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:35.082
No. The Prosecution oversaw
the closing of that case.

00:14:35.165 --> 00:14:36.333
Are you okay?

00:14:37.793 --> 00:14:40.045
If it's too much,
transfer the case to another team.

00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:41.547
I'm fine.

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:43.883
My team can handle it.

00:14:43.966 --> 00:14:46.802
You had it the hardest back then too.

00:14:47.386 --> 00:14:51.265
That woman refused
to talk to anyone else but me.

00:14:51.348 --> 00:14:52.766
What choice did we have?

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:56.520
I also wanted to see it through.

00:14:56.604 --> 00:14:58.105
Right.

00:14:58.188 --> 00:14:59.857
And you got a special one-rank promotion.

00:15:02.818 --> 00:15:05.404
A serial killer
with five victims under her belt

00:15:05.487 --> 00:15:07.489
has her jail cell decorated like a hotel,

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:10.659
and enjoys the same food and drinks as us?

00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:12.453
In secret, no less.

00:15:12.536 --> 00:15:14.038
With the taxpayer's money.

00:15:15.706 --> 00:15:18.375
She was always busy
drawing the human anatomy.

00:15:18.459 --> 00:15:20.294
Just sends a chill down my spine.

00:15:20.377 --> 00:15:22.046
And such unnervingly luxurious tastes.

00:15:22.713 --> 00:15:24.423
I hear she only drinks espresso.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:37.478
Jeong-ho!

00:15:38.228 --> 00:15:39.355
Come here.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.529
Yes, that was one
of the conditions she set

00:15:48.113 --> 00:15:49.490
for her confession.

00:15:54.578 --> 00:15:57.331
The bigwigs who handed down
the final sentence

00:15:57.957 --> 00:15:59.333
are either retired or dead.

00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:02.836
You and I are the only ones
who remain in the field.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.506
So if the shit hits the fan,
the ones who will be splashed

00:16:05.589 --> 00:16:07.007
are you and me.

00:16:07.091 --> 00:16:08.676
This won't get out.

00:16:08.759 --> 00:16:12.096
Only a select few know about it
within the organization.

00:16:12.179 --> 00:16:15.933
And when they find out this is
a Mantis copycat murder?

00:16:16.016 --> 00:16:18.060
They'll all be talking
about the Mantis again.

00:16:18.143 --> 00:16:20.312
"Where is she right now?
Reveal the truth."

00:16:20.396 --> 00:16:21.855
The Mantis

00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:24.483
died while serving her prison sentence.

00:16:24.566 --> 00:16:26.527
That's what everyone thinks.

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:29.113
But she didn't, that's the issue.

00:16:29.697 --> 00:16:31.323
We catch the culprit, and it's over.

00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:33.409
I'll see it through.

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:35.869
You caught Jeong I-shin.

00:16:35.953 --> 00:16:37.955
Make sure you catch her copycat too.

00:17:11.196 --> 00:17:12.406
It has been a while.

00:17:25.836 --> 00:17:28.964
Just like last time, I have a condition.

00:17:34.803 --> 00:17:37.056
Su-yeol. Cha Su-yeol!

00:17:41.477 --> 00:17:43.353
Inspector Cha Su-yeol.

00:17:43.437 --> 00:17:45.189
Did you catch a lot of junkies today?

00:17:45.272 --> 00:17:46.982
What are you doing here?

00:17:48.942 --> 00:17:51.528
You know… I missed you?

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:55.074
How's Jung-yeon doing?

00:17:55.157 --> 00:17:56.450
Shouldn't you be working?

00:17:56.533 --> 00:17:58.952
The Nodu Stream Case
has gone nowhere after a month.

00:17:59.036 --> 00:18:01.246
I know, it's something else.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:02.498
I'm dying over here.

00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:04.083
That's why I came to see you.

00:18:04.166 --> 00:18:06.293
You know you're so much smarter than I am.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:10.631
Help me out here.

00:18:11.673 --> 00:18:13.926
I don't have time to waste.
Hurry up and take a look.

00:18:14.009 --> 00:18:15.803
What do I know?

00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:17.596
Jeez… Forget it.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.057
I'm done with all this.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.351
Why? Did you get into trouble?

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:24.770
Yes, I did.

00:18:24.853 --> 00:18:27.689
Move it. I need to be home early today.

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:30.067
Come on, don't be like that.

00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:31.777
Come on!

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:34.071
Don't get cute with me, Mister.

00:18:35.197 --> 00:18:38.075
I guess I'll have to take a look
so you can be on your way.

00:18:38.158 --> 00:18:39.159
Let's see here.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.705
Damn punk did that
with someone's tongue?

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:45.666
They must be the type
who enjoys the thrill.

00:18:45.749 --> 00:18:46.834
First impression?

00:18:46.917 --> 00:18:49.044
Right, so on the surface, they're the type

00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:51.755
that just lets loose and goes all out
because they enjoy it so much.

00:18:54.258 --> 00:18:55.425
What the?

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:58.345
That hurts, damn it!

00:18:58.428 --> 00:18:59.471
Don't put up a fight.

00:18:59.555 --> 00:19:01.557
I'll let you go once you hear me out.

00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:03.267
What's gotten into you?

00:19:03.934 --> 00:19:07.938
The culprit perfectly imitated
that murder from 23 years ago.

00:19:08.021 --> 00:19:10.315
As you've said,
they are having the time of their life.

00:19:10.899 --> 00:19:12.860
Which means this will not be the end.

00:19:12.943 --> 00:19:16.071
We're not even close
to catching a glimpse of them.

00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:17.948
Good luck with that.

00:19:18.532 --> 00:19:20.784
Let me go first.
Then, we can talk some more.

00:19:22.035 --> 00:19:23.036
Su-yeol.

00:19:23.912 --> 00:19:26.039
Wrap up your cases by the end of the week.

00:19:26.123 --> 00:19:27.499
And take a day off.

00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:29.376
What are you even going on about?

00:19:33.505 --> 00:19:35.883
Jeong I-shin has agreed
to help with this case.

00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:38.594
What?

00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:41.180
But she says…

00:19:42.973 --> 00:19:44.975
she will only talk to you.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.437
The commissioner already approved it.

00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:50.230
You'll join my team.

00:19:55.944 --> 00:19:57.696
Unlock this now.

00:19:58.405 --> 00:20:00.657
Beheading and drowning are next.

00:20:00.741 --> 00:20:03.118
There will only be more victims
if we don't stop them now.

00:20:03.827 --> 00:20:05.579
We need to move before it blows up.

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:08.040
Turning your back on someone you can save

00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:10.459
is no different from killing them.

00:20:12.628 --> 00:20:14.463
Goddamnit!

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:21.511
Have you lost your mind?

00:20:21.595 --> 00:20:23.180
How could you ask me to do that?

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:28.936
Did you really just ask me to see her?

00:20:31.772 --> 00:20:33.982
You punk. Such a nasty temper.

00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:35.984
The key is in your pocket.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:45.661
Su-yeol.

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:48.455
Just think it over.

00:21:13.355 --> 00:21:16.858
RAYEON CERAMIC STUDIO

00:21:26.034 --> 00:21:28.495
Jeong I-shin has agreed
to help with this case.

00:21:29.246 --> 00:21:30.747
But she says

00:21:30.831 --> 00:21:32.666
she will only talk to you.

00:21:44.803 --> 00:21:45.887
What are you doing?

00:21:46.513 --> 00:21:47.681
What's wrong?

00:21:48.223 --> 00:21:49.725
What's the matter?

00:21:51.685 --> 00:21:53.103
I thought this was hard to get.

00:21:54.313 --> 00:21:55.605
It was.

00:21:55.689 --> 00:21:57.899
But I realized
I've just been blaming the clay.

00:21:57.983 --> 00:22:00.485
This clay is to blame for the wrong color,

00:22:00.569 --> 00:22:02.654
and this clay is to blame
for the rough texture.

00:22:02.738 --> 00:22:05.157
When my lack of skills
is the real issue. Right?

00:22:06.366 --> 00:22:08.285
-Should I just dump the whole thing?
-Don't do that.

00:22:08.368 --> 00:22:09.619
Just hold on.

00:22:10.454 --> 00:22:14.082
We can just scoop it back out.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.087
See. No problem.

00:22:21.256 --> 00:22:22.257
There we go.

00:22:26.261 --> 00:22:27.387
Come here, honey.

00:22:32.142 --> 00:22:33.477
Take in a deep breath.

00:22:36.313 --> 00:22:38.815
One, two, three.

00:22:39.649 --> 00:22:42.986
One, two, three.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:44.738
Don't do something you'll regret later.

00:22:44.821 --> 00:22:47.282
One, two, three.

00:23:11.181 --> 00:23:13.391
RAYEON CERAMIC STUDIO

00:23:23.276 --> 00:23:25.946
A HEINOUS MURDER
AT A MOVING COMPANY WAREHOUSE

00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:27.239
Cha Su-yeol.

00:23:27.781 --> 00:23:28.990
You should become a cop.

00:23:30.033 --> 00:23:31.827
Since five people have died,

00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:35.539
you can save five people.

00:23:36.998 --> 00:23:39.126
"Turning your back on someone you can save

00:23:39.209 --> 00:23:40.919
is no different from killing them."

00:23:43.046 --> 00:23:46.508
Commissioner, is it true
the victim was beheaded?

00:23:46.591 --> 00:23:49.219
Is there a chance
the two murders are connected?

00:23:49.302 --> 00:23:51.221
The investigation is underway.

00:23:51.304 --> 00:23:53.640
We'll have
an official press conference soon.

00:23:53.723 --> 00:23:54.850
That's it for now.

00:23:54.933 --> 00:23:57.769
-Commissioner!
-Sir! Just a moment!

00:23:57.853 --> 00:23:59.813
Are the two murders connected?

00:23:59.896 --> 00:24:01.690
-Please give us a statement.
-Commissioner.

00:24:01.773 --> 00:24:04.025
-Please give us a statement.
-Just a moment.

00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:05.443
-Commissioner.
-Sir.

00:24:18.373 --> 00:24:19.666
What did she ask for?

00:24:19.749 --> 00:24:21.418
She wouldn't help for no reason.

00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:23.044
She has two conditions.

00:24:23.128 --> 00:24:25.630
The first was you.
The second was location.

00:24:25.714 --> 00:24:27.674
She wants to see you outside of prison.

00:24:27.757 --> 00:24:31.052
It worked out. It'll be easier
for us to go back and forth.

00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:32.304
And security?

00:24:32.387 --> 00:24:35.098
You don't need to worry about that.
That's all taken care of.

00:24:40.896 --> 00:24:43.064
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

00:24:43.148 --> 00:24:44.357
I feel…

00:24:44.941 --> 00:24:45.942
Nothing.

00:24:46.568 --> 00:24:47.986
I don't even remember her face.

00:24:53.825 --> 00:24:55.118
PERSONAL BELONGINGS

00:24:56.745 --> 00:24:58.330
What's she after?

00:24:59.497 --> 00:25:00.874
What does she want with me?

00:25:01.833 --> 00:25:03.293
You could've just done it.

00:25:04.127 --> 00:25:05.420
Who knows?

00:25:06.504 --> 00:25:07.714
Maybe she missed you?

00:25:09.633 --> 00:25:12.344
That is not a funny joke. You know better.

00:25:15.138 --> 00:25:16.806
I wasn't joking.

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:19.726
Twenty-three years is a long time.
Long enough to change someone.

00:25:21.478 --> 00:25:22.979
That does sound exasperating.

00:25:24.356 --> 00:25:26.316
Twenty-three years
as an unconvicted prisoner…

00:25:33.615 --> 00:25:36.618
PERSONAL BELONGINGS

00:26:29.921 --> 00:26:31.631
It looks like a regular house, doesn't it?

00:26:31.715 --> 00:26:34.676
It was a safe house, and then,
it became a containment residence.

00:26:34.759 --> 00:26:37.554
A sort of prison run
by the National Intelligence Service.

00:26:41.641 --> 00:26:44.602
I know you're dealing with a lot,
but you can't mess this up.

00:26:45.395 --> 00:26:46.604
I'm good.

00:26:46.688 --> 00:26:48.565
It's my job to see criminals every day.

00:26:49.774 --> 00:26:51.735
All right. Let's just focus on our jobs.

00:26:53.862 --> 00:26:56.573
She may be a death row inmate,

00:26:57.449 --> 00:26:59.200
but she'll probably outlive us all.

00:27:00.785 --> 00:27:03.830
You just make sure
the security remains tight.

00:27:03.913 --> 00:27:06.458
Don't worry about that.
There's no way this will get out.

00:27:09.085 --> 00:27:11.296
This can never get out. Never.

00:27:12.464 --> 00:27:14.049
If the world finds out about this,

00:27:14.132 --> 00:27:15.508
you know what will happen.

00:27:15.592 --> 00:27:18.303
And you know
I can't live without Jung-yeon.

00:27:22.182 --> 00:27:23.183
I know.

00:27:24.392 --> 00:27:26.269
It took a lot for you to come here.

00:27:26.353 --> 00:27:27.645
That will never happen.

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:29.647
Trust me.

00:27:47.791 --> 00:27:49.376
Hey. We're here.

00:27:54.881 --> 00:27:57.550
Officer Kim Woo-tae is from
the Guard Division of Public Security.

00:27:57.634 --> 00:28:00.595
He is under special orders
from the commissioner to oversee

00:28:00.678 --> 00:28:02.305
this place until the case is closed.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.063
Is she allowed to come out here?

00:28:10.605 --> 00:28:13.149
Yes, for an hour after lunch.

00:28:13.817 --> 00:28:15.151
She takes a quick walk too.

00:28:15.235 --> 00:28:16.361
"Walk"?

00:28:16.945 --> 00:28:18.863
Then, what about the escape risk?

00:28:26.621 --> 00:28:28.248
Are you here by yourself?

00:28:28.331 --> 00:28:31.376
For 24 hours a day, with no shift change,
just by yourself?

00:28:31.459 --> 00:28:33.336
The fewer people know about this,
the better.

00:28:34.504 --> 00:28:35.755
Let's go inside.

00:29:01.239 --> 00:29:02.282
Ms. Jeong.

00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:05.994
You have agreed to assist
on the recent copycat murder case,

00:29:06.077 --> 00:29:07.620
and we're here to question you.

00:29:09.748 --> 00:29:11.082
You must be Jeong-ho.

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:22.510
I am Inspector Cha Su-yeol
from the Major Crimes Investigation Unit.

00:29:26.222 --> 00:29:27.474
Have you reviewed the file?

00:29:30.185 --> 00:29:31.936
You must be married.

00:29:32.687 --> 00:29:34.355
You have a ring mark.

00:29:36.316 --> 00:29:37.525
Do you have kids too?

00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:53.500
Let's keep all discussion
to the case at hand.

00:29:53.583 --> 00:29:57.295
I did not come here for a family reunion.

00:29:57.378 --> 00:29:58.922
Have you reviewed the file?

00:30:11.017 --> 00:30:13.019
JINSIM EXPRESS MURDER CASE

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:20.443
They certainly made quite an effort

00:30:21.152 --> 00:30:23.488
to replicate it.

00:30:25.281 --> 00:30:27.325
I'd say it was more
for pleasure than business.

00:30:27.867 --> 00:30:29.452
If you look at the severed neck,

00:30:30.036 --> 00:30:32.455
you'll see the edges are clean.
A single decisive strike.

00:30:32.997 --> 00:30:34.165
That's where we differ.

00:30:34.999 --> 00:30:36.292
I use a saw.

00:30:36.376 --> 00:30:40.880
When the teeth of the saw
grind down the neck bone,

00:30:40.964 --> 00:30:42.632
each stroke reverberates through the body.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.927
Back and forth.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.974
It seems this one
doesn't know about such pleasures.

00:30:52.475 --> 00:30:54.227
An ax must mean it's a he?

00:30:55.103 --> 00:30:56.271
Solid strength.

00:30:58.857 --> 00:31:00.859
You need to give us something else,

00:31:02.485 --> 00:31:04.654
something that's not already
in the report analysis.

00:31:08.825 --> 00:31:11.286
Is this all? No more pictures or reports?

00:31:12.245 --> 00:31:14.038
There's not much here.

00:31:17.083 --> 00:31:18.710
You can spare us the idle chatter.

00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:23.131
This is all the team can provide for you.

00:31:24.007 --> 00:31:25.341
The culprit

00:31:25.425 --> 00:31:28.720
has adopted your modus operandi perfectly

00:31:29.429 --> 00:31:31.014
to kill two people already.

00:31:33.266 --> 00:31:34.601
Bring me more pictures.

00:31:35.977 --> 00:31:37.896
We can chat some more then.

00:31:37.979 --> 00:31:39.689
Inspector Cha Su-yeol.

00:31:40.315 --> 00:31:41.232
Until next time.

00:31:43.192 --> 00:31:44.611
The pictures made you smile.

00:31:46.321 --> 00:31:47.614
You must be enjoying this.

00:31:49.449 --> 00:31:50.783
A stroll down memory lane?

00:31:50.867 --> 00:31:51.868
Captain Cha.

00:31:51.951 --> 00:31:54.829
Do they excite you?

00:31:56.164 --> 00:31:57.457
Do they make you smell blood?

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:02.712
Does blood smell bad?

00:32:04.839 --> 00:32:05.715
You

00:32:06.716 --> 00:32:09.886
were lodged upside down, and they said
the only way out was to cut my belly open.

00:32:11.095 --> 00:32:12.347
During the surgery,

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:15.934
for some odd reason,
the anesthesia wore off.

00:32:16.517 --> 00:32:18.728
I endured it.

00:32:19.979 --> 00:32:22.857
Because I was afraid
something might happen to you if I moved.

00:32:24.359 --> 00:32:27.612
I heard them rummage through
my sliced belly with gloved hands

00:32:27.695 --> 00:32:28.655
and felt it.

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:32.241
That's how you were born.

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:35.036
The smell of blood?

00:32:35.119 --> 00:32:36.454
I like it.

00:32:37.872 --> 00:32:40.667
That was the scent hanging in the air
when you were born.

00:32:50.593 --> 00:32:51.803
I see.

00:32:53.429 --> 00:32:55.056
It's too bad.

00:32:56.766 --> 00:32:59.769
Unfortunately, I'm a police officer
who encounters countless criminals

00:33:00.395 --> 00:33:03.481
and has no interest
in their lives or past,

00:33:04.315 --> 00:33:08.152
Ms. Jeong, who is so particularly fond
of the scent of blood.

00:33:09.195 --> 00:33:10.488
We'll look into more photos.

00:33:10.571 --> 00:33:12.949
We'll stop here for today and leave you.

00:33:13.032 --> 00:33:14.158
Let's go.

00:33:15.159 --> 00:33:18.413
Could I visit the crime scene?

00:33:20.081 --> 00:33:21.749
I was just suddenly reminded of something,

00:33:23.251 --> 00:33:24.961
and I wanted to check for myself.

00:33:31.134 --> 00:33:32.135
I'll take my meal now.

00:33:43.146 --> 00:33:46.149
It won't matter if it's 23 or 230 years.
She'll never change.

00:33:47.525 --> 00:33:49.068
She milks the system for all it has

00:33:49.152 --> 00:33:50.611
without the slightest bit of remorse.

00:33:50.695 --> 00:33:52.321
You saw her, acting like it's a picnic.

00:33:52.405 --> 00:33:54.240
She'll exploit the fact
she has the upper hand

00:33:54.323 --> 00:33:58.036
and stall as much as she can for fun.
This is all just a part of her nonsense.

00:33:58.119 --> 00:34:01.205
I don't care what it is.
I just need to catch the culprit.

00:34:01.914 --> 00:34:05.501
Time we should spend catching the culprit
will be wasted indulging her whims.

00:34:06.127 --> 00:34:07.628
Is she really going to the crime scene?

00:34:07.712 --> 00:34:08.838
We have to take her.

00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:12.884
There's no way she's doing this
just for some fresh air.

00:34:28.024 --> 00:34:29.859
Twenty-three years ago,

00:34:29.942 --> 00:34:32.320
in my hands, I had evidence

00:34:32.403 --> 00:34:34.405
of just one of her murders.

00:34:35.782 --> 00:34:37.867
Even that was abstract,
I had no physical evidence.

00:34:39.285 --> 00:34:41.412
The country was busy
celebrating the World Cup,

00:34:41.496 --> 00:34:44.957
and news of a serial killer
was a major political liability.

00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:47.543
The politicians called every day.

00:34:47.627 --> 00:34:49.962
I reached for
that miserably tattered lifeline

00:34:50.046 --> 00:34:53.299
and arrested her,
clinging to a pitiful shred of hope.

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:59.347
The moment I arrested her,
she looked at me and smirked.

00:35:00.598 --> 00:35:02.058
It was as if

00:35:02.141 --> 00:35:05.019
she knew that day would come.

00:35:06.562 --> 00:35:08.147
With nothing but my own conviction,

00:35:08.231 --> 00:35:09.857
I desperately needed her confession.

00:35:10.566 --> 00:35:12.985
And she knew that.

00:35:14.237 --> 00:35:15.154
We had

00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:19.450
no choice but to give in to her demands.

00:35:21.494 --> 00:35:22.411
A solitary cell,

00:35:23.287 --> 00:35:24.664
music,

00:35:24.747 --> 00:35:25.748
and coffee.

00:35:26.374 --> 00:35:27.375
That's right.

00:35:27.875 --> 00:35:29.127
And…

00:35:32.588 --> 00:35:35.800
Anyhow, if she makes a deal,
she follows through.

00:35:36.342 --> 00:35:38.094
She'd never let herself be indebted.

00:36:16.757 --> 00:36:18.885
JUSIN CHURCH

00:36:36.944 --> 00:36:38.154
Eun-ae.

00:36:44.202 --> 00:36:45.203
My goodness.

00:36:47.079 --> 00:36:48.956
It looks like she's settling in well.

00:36:51.334 --> 00:36:54.962
I'm sorry for just springing her on you.
CPS didn't have space for her.

00:36:55.046 --> 00:36:57.173
Just look after her
until they find her a spot.

00:36:57.965 --> 00:36:59.550
You don't need to apologize.

00:36:59.634 --> 00:37:01.135
She's a cute kid.

00:37:01.844 --> 00:37:04.430
I was getting lonely anyway.
It brings back memories.

00:37:04.513 --> 00:37:05.848
It's nice.

00:37:06.474 --> 00:37:08.768
You're already taking
a fistful of pills every day.

00:37:08.851 --> 00:37:10.353
As if aging is worth bragging about.

00:37:10.436 --> 00:37:13.314
If something bad happens,
and there's a kid there?

00:37:13.397 --> 00:37:16.901
Then, that kid is
the biggest victim there, no matter what.

00:37:16.984 --> 00:37:19.028
There you go again with that.

00:37:19.862 --> 00:37:21.530
It must be the millionth time by now.

00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:27.036
I didn't pack much
because it's just the two of you.

00:37:27.119 --> 00:37:29.413
I froze the corn as soon as I picked it.

00:37:29.497 --> 00:37:32.124
Make sure to put them in the freezer.
Okay?

00:37:32.208 --> 00:37:33.167
I'm off.

00:37:34.085 --> 00:37:35.878
Stay for dinner. You came all this way.

00:37:35.962 --> 00:37:37.838
I need to go.

00:37:37.922 --> 00:37:39.507
Eun-ae needs to eat.

00:37:40.174 --> 00:37:43.010
She's smiling and playful
for the majority of the time,

00:37:43.844 --> 00:37:45.680
but sometimes,
she says the strangest things.

00:37:45.763 --> 00:37:47.431
She's unwell.

00:37:47.515 --> 00:37:48.891
What does she say?

00:37:48.975 --> 00:37:51.560
She says someone
shot her mother to kill her.

00:37:52.144 --> 00:37:53.562
It's not like we're in the States.

00:37:53.646 --> 00:37:54.939
Don't worry about it.

00:37:55.022 --> 00:37:56.649
I'm heading out. No need to see me off.

00:38:01.737 --> 00:38:03.155
She's telling the truth.

00:38:05.408 --> 00:38:07.368
What do you think?
It's a different color, right?

00:38:08.411 --> 00:38:10.538
This is really your work?

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:12.456
I told you it is.

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:17.837
No, it's not. It can't be.

00:38:18.504 --> 00:38:19.547
Hold on.

00:38:21.507 --> 00:38:22.758
I need to look at it outside.

00:38:26.637 --> 00:38:28.389
I figured you out, you brat.

00:38:28.973 --> 00:38:29.932
You changed clay.

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.144
Where did you get this from?

00:38:33.227 --> 00:38:35.146
The texture is totally different.

00:38:36.063 --> 00:38:37.440
I did change clay,

00:38:37.523 --> 00:38:41.110
but I also had a great change of heart?

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:45.614
-The color's not bad, right?
-Yeah. So pretty.

00:38:47.408 --> 00:38:48.534
Mr. Jeong must be here.

00:38:50.244 --> 00:38:51.454
Wait here.

00:38:56.292 --> 00:38:58.085
I just got so angry suddenly.

00:38:58.169 --> 00:38:59.795
She could've gotten hurt.

00:39:00.921 --> 00:39:01.964
Su-yeol.

00:39:04.133 --> 00:39:05.760
You saved Eun-ae.

00:39:06.927 --> 00:39:08.054
No, it wasn't that.

00:39:09.388 --> 00:39:10.973
This wasn't the first time, either.

00:39:12.641 --> 00:39:13.893
I, too…

00:39:16.062 --> 00:39:17.480
don't like this part of myself.

00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:19.357
It's okay.

00:39:20.358 --> 00:39:21.484
You'll be okay.

00:39:22.401 --> 00:39:24.111
I saw her.

00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:25.905
Eun-ae's mother?

00:39:25.988 --> 00:39:27.114
I…

00:39:28.282 --> 00:39:29.658
still have those dreams.

00:39:30.284 --> 00:39:31.202
What?

00:39:31.786 --> 00:39:32.912
I dream about that woman

00:39:34.497 --> 00:39:35.998
stabbing people

00:39:36.999 --> 00:39:38.626
-and cutting them up--
-Su-yeol.

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:40.878
And she's smiling…

00:39:40.961 --> 00:39:42.129
Why would you see her?

00:39:49.929 --> 00:39:51.806
You know about
the recent murder cases, right?

00:39:52.473 --> 00:39:54.308
Some crazy bastard

00:39:54.392 --> 00:39:56.477
is copying everything
that woman did in the past.

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:59.814
That's why we needed her assistance.

00:39:59.897 --> 00:40:01.148
You can't!

00:40:01.232 --> 00:40:03.526
Are you the only police officer in Korea?

00:40:03.609 --> 00:40:05.653
You said you still have nightmares!

00:40:09.031 --> 00:40:10.950
Don't worry about me, okay?

00:40:12.368 --> 00:40:13.702
I'm not a kid.

00:40:15.204 --> 00:40:17.790
It happened 23 years ago.

00:40:17.873 --> 00:40:19.583
The scary woman

00:40:19.667 --> 00:40:22.169
who killed people and smiled at me

00:40:22.253 --> 00:40:24.880
is now, nothing more than a criminal

00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:28.634
who's old and powerless.

00:40:29.635 --> 00:40:31.011
Confirming that fact

00:40:31.804 --> 00:40:32.805
could help me

00:40:34.432 --> 00:40:35.891
find some peace.

00:40:36.851 --> 00:40:37.810
No, that won't happen.

00:40:38.853 --> 00:40:39.979
What she did…

00:40:40.604 --> 00:40:41.814
She is the devil.

00:40:43.607 --> 00:40:45.484
No one finds peace by seeing the devil.

00:40:47.319 --> 00:40:49.864
You must never see her again. Promise me.

00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:51.449
Once was more than enough.

00:40:52.158 --> 00:40:53.534
Do you hear me?

00:40:54.702 --> 00:40:55.703
I…

00:41:14.221 --> 00:41:16.265
What's wrong? Did you see somebody?

00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:18.225
No, it's nothing.

00:41:18.809 --> 00:41:20.561
I'm fine. I can still walk by myself.

00:41:21.437 --> 00:41:23.230
I'm just going to leave quietly.
Go back inside.

00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:25.149
Thank you for all the food.

00:41:25.232 --> 00:41:26.233
All right.

00:41:32.031 --> 00:41:34.241
You can't. He already told you no.

00:41:36.035 --> 00:41:38.496
So I just accept that "no"
and call it a day?

00:41:38.579 --> 00:41:40.998
We're completely stuck here.

00:41:41.081 --> 00:41:42.124
We need to just go for it…

00:41:43.709 --> 00:41:45.085
Okay. You stay here.

00:41:47.171 --> 00:41:48.631
Hey. Kim!

00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:52.843
NAMBU POLICE,
TRUSTED AND LOVED BY THE PEOPLE

00:41:55.804 --> 00:41:56.680
Sir.

00:41:56.764 --> 00:41:58.098
Hey.

00:41:58.182 --> 00:41:59.975
I'd like to ask you again.

00:42:00.059 --> 00:42:01.727
Please allow me to meet with Jeong I-shin.

00:42:03.229 --> 00:42:06.607
The culprit is copying
even the smallest details from her crimes.

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:07.858
I'm sure I'll find something.

00:42:08.776 --> 00:42:11.987
My goodness. I thought
I already gave you an answer for that.

00:42:19.495 --> 00:42:21.497
Could you reconsider it, just this once?

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:22.498
Sir.

00:42:22.581 --> 00:42:26.418
I can draft a questionnaire beforehand
if you give me permission.

00:42:26.502 --> 00:42:27.586
My goodness.

00:42:29.129 --> 00:42:30.422
I already told you.

00:42:30.506 --> 00:42:33.467
Telling you she was alive
was already seen as a liability

00:42:33.551 --> 00:42:34.843
by the higher-ups.

00:42:34.927 --> 00:42:38.097
I had to fight tooth and nail to argue
the ones investigating the case

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:39.348
should know, at least.

00:42:39.431 --> 00:42:41.850
That's how I was
barely able to tell you all.

00:42:41.934 --> 00:42:44.019
Think about how it makes me look
if you keep this up.

00:42:44.103 --> 00:42:47.523
Then, why bother telling us she's alive?

00:42:47.606 --> 00:42:49.984
You told us
because you were thinking about it too.

00:42:58.534 --> 00:42:59.994
What if she wants to?

00:43:00.786 --> 00:43:02.246
Criminals are all the same.

00:43:02.329 --> 00:43:05.082
She must be itching to prattle on
about what she had done.

00:43:05.165 --> 00:43:07.960
If we just give her a scratch,
I guarantee we'll get something.

00:43:10.004 --> 00:43:11.755
Can you at least try filing a request…

00:43:14.633 --> 00:43:16.427
Hey. Come in.

00:43:20.222 --> 00:43:22.016
Everyone, listen up.

00:43:22.766 --> 00:43:25.227
This is Inspector Cha Su-yeol,
and he'll be joining our team.

00:43:26.687 --> 00:43:29.189
What? What happened to "no backup"?

00:43:29.773 --> 00:43:30.858
Hello, everyone.

00:43:31.525 --> 00:43:34.612
I will be your new squad leader.
I look forward to working with you all.

00:43:35.237 --> 00:43:38.240
It'll be hard for him to adjust
after such a sudden transfer.

00:43:38.324 --> 00:43:39.658
Be sure to help him out.

00:43:47.708 --> 00:43:48.751
It's nice to meet you.

00:43:48.834 --> 00:43:49.793
I'm Kim Na-hee.

00:43:50.419 --> 00:43:51.629
I'm Cha Su-yeol.

00:43:53.255 --> 00:43:54.882
-Well? Come on.
-I…

00:43:57.384 --> 00:43:58.385
Who are you?

00:44:00.888 --> 00:44:04.558
After incapacitating the victim
with an injection of anesthesia,

00:44:04.642 --> 00:44:07.603
she killed him by dismemberment
and other brutal acts after he awoke.

00:44:07.686 --> 00:44:10.064
She went out of her way
to make it a painful death.

00:44:10.147 --> 00:44:12.066
The fact that she went to such lengths--

00:44:12.149 --> 00:44:14.318
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Just give me a moment.

00:44:14.902 --> 00:44:18.489
Could we go back to the pictures
of the second murder?

00:44:18.572 --> 00:44:19.615
Sure.

00:44:19.698 --> 00:44:21.200
2025 CRIME SCENE

00:44:21.283 --> 00:44:22.618
Yes, that slide.

00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:25.913
That mirror there.

00:44:25.996 --> 00:44:29.583
I believe there was no mirror
at the murder scene 23 years ago.

00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:32.002
Yes, we also found that a bit odd.

00:44:32.086 --> 00:44:36.256
We suspect the culprit had
the victim watch himself die.

00:44:38.092 --> 00:44:41.178
There was no mirror
for the first murder by the stream.

00:44:41.261 --> 00:44:44.515
This is the first time he used a mirror.

00:44:44.598 --> 00:44:45.599
If that's the case,

00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:48.477
he might not be just copying them.

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:51.647
We could view this addition
as his attempt to add a personal touch.

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:53.148
You could,

00:44:53.232 --> 00:44:55.359
but that was done
in a moving company's warehouse,

00:44:55.442 --> 00:44:56.777
and the mirror had been there.

00:45:02.199 --> 00:45:03.283
In that spot?

00:45:07.204 --> 00:45:08.539
We didn't check that…

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:10.999
You should've checked for traces.

00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:16.046
If the culprit had intentionally moved
the mirror to that spot,

00:45:16.964 --> 00:45:19.508
then, that would be a meaningful gesture.

00:45:20.092 --> 00:45:22.928
He acts like he respects Jeong I-shin,

00:45:23.011 --> 00:45:25.431
but he may secretly believe he's better,

00:45:25.514 --> 00:45:28.684
that he managed to inflict
a more painful death on his victim.

00:45:28.767 --> 00:45:31.854
This could be his way
of revealing such arrogance.

00:45:31.937 --> 00:45:34.273
Is this a battle of pain or something?

00:45:34.356 --> 00:45:35.566
What if it was?

00:45:35.649 --> 00:45:36.859
If so,

00:45:37.443 --> 00:45:41.405
he could even end up slipping up
after pushing himself too far

00:45:41.488 --> 00:45:43.115
to show that he's better.

00:45:43.866 --> 00:45:46.869
We don't intend to have more victims.

00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:48.579
Of course not.

00:45:48.662 --> 00:45:51.707
That's why we have
gathered here like this.

00:45:55.669 --> 00:45:58.464
What about the victims?
Are there any similarities?

00:45:58.547 --> 00:46:01.258
The victims from 23 years ago
were all known to have assaulted

00:46:01.341 --> 00:46:03.427
or abused women and children.

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:04.386
However,

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:06.972
that is shared only by his first victim.

00:46:07.055 --> 00:46:09.933
Because his two victims
don't share similarities,

00:46:10.017 --> 00:46:12.060
it is hard to predict his next victim.

00:46:12.144 --> 00:46:14.771
We only have
an idea of his next murder method.

00:46:14.855 --> 00:46:18.066
Then, the third murder
in the killings 23 years ago was…

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:19.610
Drowning.

00:46:21.695 --> 00:46:23.947
That means the third victim
will drown to death.

00:46:24.948 --> 00:46:26.950
But as of now, we have no other clues.

00:46:27.034 --> 00:46:29.536
We have dashcam footage
from a car parked near the warehouse.

00:46:38.253 --> 00:46:40.797
It's very dark.
Can we adjust the brightness?

00:46:40.881 --> 00:46:42.382
It's the highest it'll go.

00:46:42.966 --> 00:46:45.177
Good job, everyone.

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:48.805
We can stop here. It's his first day.

00:46:48.889 --> 00:46:50.224
That's good enough of an intro.

00:46:50.307 --> 00:46:52.017
I'd like to make a request.

00:46:52.518 --> 00:46:54.478
I wish to meet Jeong I-shin.

00:46:54.561 --> 00:46:56.647
The culprit is imitating her.

00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:59.900
I believe she would know something.
What do you think?

00:46:59.983 --> 00:47:01.818
Kim, we already discussed this.

00:47:11.453 --> 00:47:13.539
Have we done enough in our investigation?

00:47:15.374 --> 00:47:17.334
If we had, perhaps we could.

00:47:18.126 --> 00:47:19.086
But if not,

00:47:19.169 --> 00:47:21.296
I do not want us relying on a criminal.

00:47:21.922 --> 00:47:24.466
She had been locked up for 23 years.

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:26.260
I wonder how helpful she could be.

00:47:26.843 --> 00:47:27.844
But--

00:47:27.928 --> 00:47:28.845
Drop it.

00:47:29.972 --> 00:47:32.099
Let's go and offer our greetings
to the commissioner.

00:47:39.147 --> 00:47:41.441
What? An insufficient investigation?

00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:43.235
He's saying we were slacking.

00:47:44.111 --> 00:47:46.405
He just rolls in here
and thinks he knows everything.

00:47:47.114 --> 00:47:49.992
Watch what you say. We're on the same team
at the end of the day.

00:47:51.451 --> 00:47:52.744
Who wants coffee?

00:47:52.828 --> 00:47:53.870
Iced plum tea.

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:05.090
What a big heart she has.

00:48:05.841 --> 00:48:06.842
I know, right?

00:48:09.803 --> 00:48:11.555
Then, what should we do with this?

00:48:12.389 --> 00:48:14.683
I've been carrying it around,
just in case.

00:48:14.766 --> 00:48:15.642
What?

00:48:15.726 --> 00:48:17.769
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR PROMOTION
SQUAD LEADER KIM!

00:48:17.853 --> 00:48:19.938
YOU ARE THE BEST THERE EVER WAS!
FROM HYUK, SUNG-GYU

00:49:16.912 --> 00:49:18.246
PASSION GUKBAP

00:49:20.415 --> 00:49:22.084
Here's your grilled meat.

00:49:23.377 --> 00:49:24.878
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

00:49:30.133 --> 00:49:32.594
-Excuse me.
-Coming.

00:49:32.678 --> 00:49:35.722
Sir, since this is our first dinner
with the new squad leader and all,

00:49:35.806 --> 00:49:37.641
should we have a drink?

00:49:38.475 --> 00:49:39.476
Should we?

00:49:39.976 --> 00:49:40.936
Sure.

00:49:41.728 --> 00:49:43.897
-Go.
-Fun company dinner, here we come.

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:46.525
Can we get
some fermented baby octopus and ice?

00:49:46.608 --> 00:49:47.859
Coming.

00:49:48.944 --> 00:49:50.320
Here we go.

00:49:51.196 --> 00:49:53.490
Ma'am, can we get some soju glasses?

00:49:53.573 --> 00:49:54.491
Come on now.

00:49:54.574 --> 00:49:56.952
-Ji-an, what are these glasses for?
-Yes?

00:49:57.035 --> 00:49:58.829
-Soju.
-Soju glasses.

00:49:59.996 --> 00:50:00.997
Take one.

00:50:04.209 --> 00:50:07.170
I guess there are
only prudes in Narcotics.

00:50:07.254 --> 00:50:10.966
Bae, you just met him today.
Are you going to strip and dance already?

00:50:11.049 --> 00:50:12.342
Come on now.

00:50:12.426 --> 00:50:14.720
Don't ruin the surprise.

00:50:15.887 --> 00:50:16.763
I'm ready.

00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:18.140
Let me pour you one.

00:50:19.599 --> 00:50:22.644
It feels like I suddenly intruded
on your investigation.

00:50:23.645 --> 00:50:24.813
My apologies.

00:50:24.896 --> 00:50:27.691
I've learned that whether
it's Narcotics or Major Crimes,

00:50:27.774 --> 00:50:30.527
a true officer proves themselves
in investigations.

00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:32.446
As an officer and a squad leader,

00:50:32.529 --> 00:50:34.448
I will prove myself in the investigation.

00:50:34.531 --> 00:50:36.992
That's quite a long toast
when drinks are poured.

00:50:37.576 --> 00:50:40.203
Sir, let me welcome you
on behalf of the team.

00:50:40.287 --> 00:50:41.455
Welcome.

00:50:41.538 --> 00:50:43.039
Thank you.

00:50:49.129 --> 00:50:50.839
Who wants some beer to cleanse the palate?

00:50:50.922 --> 00:50:52.048
-Me.
-Me.

00:50:52.132 --> 00:50:53.925
-Here we go.
-Give me one.

00:50:56.136 --> 00:50:57.929
To our team!

00:50:58.013 --> 00:50:59.181
-To our team!
-To our team!

00:52:23.306 --> 00:52:26.184
JINSIM EXPRESS

00:54:13.124 --> 00:54:14.292
Does anything come to mind?

00:54:14.376 --> 00:54:15.669
Quiet.

00:54:30.809 --> 00:54:32.519
You thought of something.

00:54:35.897 --> 00:54:37.148
He moved it on purpose.

00:54:40.485 --> 00:54:43.905
It must be his way of saying
he inflicted greater pain on the victim.

00:54:43.989 --> 00:54:46.491
But he copied everything else.

00:54:47.242 --> 00:54:49.869
He limited himself to only using
what was available in here.

00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:55.792
I'm sure you didn't come here
to see how perfectly he copied it.

00:55:00.588 --> 00:55:01.715
The neck.

00:55:02.424 --> 00:55:04.134
He could've severed the head in one go,

00:55:04.217 --> 00:55:05.844
but he left it hanging on by a thread.

00:55:07.929 --> 00:55:09.180
I did that as well.

00:55:11.099 --> 00:55:12.017
Dangle.

00:55:13.184 --> 00:55:14.144
Dangle.

00:55:18.023 --> 00:55:20.900
You see, tearing it off with your hands…

00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:10.241
What is it?

00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:14.871
If the culprit wanted to imitate
that murder from 23 years ago,

00:56:14.954 --> 00:56:16.956
what would he have referenced?

00:56:17.916 --> 00:56:20.960
What was reported and shown by the media.

00:56:21.044 --> 00:56:23.922
Only one paper published
a picture of the crime scene.

00:56:24.005 --> 00:56:25.256
So?

00:56:53.535 --> 00:56:54.869
Ms. Jeong!

00:57:01.334 --> 00:57:02.377
Is that all?

00:57:04.671 --> 00:57:06.047
What about the paper? I mean…

00:57:08.383 --> 00:57:09.592
What are you trying to say?

00:57:11.010 --> 00:57:13.179
That's for the police to figure out.

00:57:14.848 --> 00:57:16.349
I'm a criminal.

00:57:17.016 --> 00:57:18.351
You're a police officer.

00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:22.439
Wasn't that our dynamic?

00:57:26.985 --> 00:57:27.986
Ms. Jeong.

00:57:29.571 --> 00:57:30.738
You know that

00:57:31.865 --> 00:57:33.783
getting approval for this
was no easy feat?

00:57:34.451 --> 00:57:36.369
You have to give us something.

00:57:44.627 --> 00:57:46.504
Forget it. Let's just stop here.

00:57:51.801 --> 00:57:53.636
SQUAD LEADER CHA

00:57:54.679 --> 00:57:55.930
Hello, Captain.

00:57:56.014 --> 00:57:57.765
A newspaper article?

00:57:58.850 --> 00:58:00.477
SERIAL KILLINGS IN ONE TOWN

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:01.769
Yes, there are.

00:58:01.853 --> 00:58:03.897
I'll text them to you.

00:58:06.566 --> 00:58:08.776
A SECOND MURDER CASE IN WOONGSAN

00:58:13.573 --> 00:58:14.908
Why did he ask for this?

00:58:16.576 --> 00:58:17.535
…BRUTAL CRIME METHOD

00:58:17.619 --> 00:58:19.579
Can you make that brighter?

00:58:19.662 --> 00:58:20.788
Brighter?

00:58:21.748 --> 00:58:24.125
Zoom in here.

00:58:39.974 --> 00:58:41.643
The image is flipped.

00:58:41.726 --> 00:58:43.895
-Yeah.
-I guess it was a printing mistake.

00:58:44.437 --> 00:58:45.897
Maybe it's the design?

00:58:46.689 --> 00:58:47.774
Hold on.

00:58:49.734 --> 00:58:50.693
What the?

00:58:52.070 --> 00:58:54.364
Then, the head
was actually on the left side,

00:58:54.447 --> 00:58:56.157
and not the right.

00:58:58.368 --> 00:59:00.286
He did not reference
this newspaper clipping.

00:59:01.204 --> 00:59:04.249
He must have seen
court or investigative records.

00:59:09.712 --> 00:59:10.797
Hey.

00:59:11.673 --> 00:59:14.717
Can you search for court
and investigative records on Jeong I-shin?

00:59:15.677 --> 00:59:16.719
You already are?

00:59:17.595 --> 00:59:18.596
Okay.

00:59:23.977 --> 00:59:24.978
Let's get out of here.

01:00:16.487 --> 01:00:18.990
Maybe he was here about a year ago?

01:00:19.073 --> 01:00:22.327
Jeong I-shin sent him
letters from Anwon Prison?

01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:24.829
While the whole world thinks
Jeong I-shin is dead…

01:00:24.912 --> 01:00:26.623
-Hey!
-What's this bastard's deal?

01:00:26.706 --> 01:00:29.125
That woman is not helping us.

01:00:29.208 --> 01:00:30.460
She's using us.

01:00:30.543 --> 01:00:32.545
What was your mom like?
What sort of person was she?

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:34.005
If I tell you,

01:00:34.088 --> 01:00:36.007
will you tell me where Kim Tae-seok is?

01:00:36.090 --> 01:00:38.217
We need to make Seo Gu-wan talk.

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:39.510
Seo Gu-wan isn't here.

01:00:39.594 --> 01:00:41.095
We need to end it.

01:00:41.179 --> 01:00:43.348
-We need to kill him now.
-Seo Gu-wan!

01:00:43.431 --> 01:00:47.560

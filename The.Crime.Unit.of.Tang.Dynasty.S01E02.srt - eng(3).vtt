00:00:50.291 --> 00:00:51.375
Come on.

00:00:51.458 --> 00:00:54.041
Please, let me go.

00:00:57.875 --> 00:00:58.833
Madam.

00:00:59.083 --> 00:00:59.916
Help me.

00:01:00.416 --> 00:01:01.833
Save me.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.708
Hmph.

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:07.833
Come on.

00:01:13.375 --> 00:01:14.958
Don't worry, Your Honor.

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:17.208
I'll solve the case for you within three days.

00:01:20.458 --> 00:01:21.541
Let me tell you,

00:01:21.916 --> 00:01:23.416
Don't try any tricks.

00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:26.583
You must stay within ten feet of me for these three days.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.458
Oh, by the way,

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:33.916
Now there are only two days left.

00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:39.875
Is your master at home?

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:41.541
My master...

00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:44.416
He's missing.

00:02:12.708 --> 00:02:13.625
What a coincidence.

00:02:13.791 --> 00:02:14.625
And you're here too.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.750
We invited the Buddhist Monk from the temple to perform last rites for Madam.

00:02:20.625 --> 00:02:22.500
Just like the old coroner who died at the mortuary last night.

00:02:22.541 --> 00:02:23.916
He was literally scared to death.

00:02:27.625 --> 00:02:29.791
I arrived late, please forgive me.

00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:31.875
Magistrate Sun.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.125
Has your wife been comforted?

00:02:35.125 --> 00:02:36.375
It's a family matter.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.916
I wouldn't dare delay the investigation.

00:02:38.166 --> 00:02:39.000
Your Excellency.

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:41.750
I heard Liu Gui is missing.

00:02:42.125 --> 00:02:43.000
That's right.

00:02:43.541 --> 00:02:44.958
Liu Gui came to steal the corpse.

00:02:45.041 --> 00:02:47.291
But he vanished along with the corpse in the mansion.

00:02:47.416 --> 00:02:49.791
And Madam Liu was scared to death.

00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:52.625
The whole Liu family

00:02:53.666 --> 00:02:55.125
is quite strange.

00:03:05.416 --> 00:03:07.250
I heard from the steward

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.166
that besides the missing Liu Yanran and the deceased Liu Qiaoqiao,

00:03:11.541 --> 00:03:14.708
Liu Gui also has a mute adopted daughter named Liu Jiaojiao.

00:03:14.833 --> 00:03:16.333
It must be her.

00:03:21.458 --> 00:03:22.750
Is she possessed or something?

00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:24.416
Please don't be offended, Your Honor.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.291
My lady has always been like this.

00:03:26.333 --> 00:03:28.500
She laughs when she wants to cry.

00:03:28.916 --> 00:03:32.083
Everyone says she has a strange illness.

00:03:53.916 --> 00:03:55.166
The greatest form is formless.

00:03:55.416 --> 00:03:56.583
The greatest sorrow is tearless.

00:03:57.833 --> 00:03:59.583
Leave her to me, the humble monk.

00:03:59.666 --> 00:04:00.458
Monk.

00:04:00.583 --> 00:04:01.541
On the day of the incident,

00:04:01.583 --> 00:04:03.458
how many times did you see Miss Liu?

00:04:03.666 --> 00:04:05.208
Do you know anything?

00:04:13.041 --> 00:04:14.416
Useless brat.

00:04:14.583 --> 00:04:16.541
You even spilled the foot-washing basin.

00:04:16.666 --> 00:04:18.208
You kneel here properly today.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.583
Hold the basin up for me.

00:04:20.166 --> 00:04:21.333
If you spill even a drop,

00:04:21.375 --> 00:04:23.250
don't ever think of entering the Liu household again.

00:04:27.125 --> 00:04:27.916
Father.

00:04:28.083 --> 00:04:29.750
Sister was just distracted for a moment.

00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.333
Please forgive her.

00:04:39.208 --> 00:04:40.333
Living Buddha.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.583
In this life,

00:04:42.916 --> 00:04:45.291
are we destined to suffer endlessly?

00:04:49.666 --> 00:04:52.000
It's hard to find a perfect solution in this world.

00:04:59.416 --> 00:05:01.583
Miss Liu Yanran is a good person.

00:05:02.208 --> 00:05:04.166
She often gives alms at the temple.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.750
Over time,

00:05:06.833 --> 00:05:09.208
she also got to know her sister Liu Qiaoqiao.

00:05:10.375 --> 00:05:13.333
But fate played a cruel trick.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.625
Are there any other strange things in your mansion?

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.208
My master rarely sleeps with Madam.

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:36.458
No one is allowed into his room.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.750
It's quite comfortable.

00:05:54.708 --> 00:05:55.708
Boss.

00:05:56.458 --> 00:05:57.333
Boss.

00:05:57.833 --> 00:05:59.625
At the home of the deceased mortuary coroner,

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.833
we found a bathtub.

00:06:26.375 --> 00:06:27.416
What?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.416
A mortuary coroner

00:06:29.458 --> 00:06:31.791
used his job as a cover to steal corpses.

00:06:32.708 --> 00:06:35.208
I can't believe right under our noses

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.041
there was such a villain.

00:06:38.833 --> 00:06:39.666
Your Excellency.

00:06:39.875 --> 00:06:42.375
Maybe he's the murderer.

00:06:44.041 --> 00:06:46.583
Liu Gui's disappearance and Madam Liu's death

00:06:47.041 --> 00:06:48.791
probably have nothing to do with him.

00:06:50.416 --> 00:06:51.291
Magistrate Sun.

00:06:51.458 --> 00:06:53.583
Leave matters here to us.

00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.333
As for the mortuary coroner,

00:06:55.416 --> 00:06:57.166
look further into his background.

00:06:57.583 --> 00:06:58.916
Rest assured, Your Excellency.

00:07:01.625 --> 00:07:02.500
Yes.

00:07:07.708 --> 00:07:09.291
So, Charlatan, what do you think?

00:07:09.625 --> 00:07:11.125
Any new discoveries?

00:07:14.666 --> 00:07:16.125
I'm staying here tonight.

00:07:16.875 --> 00:07:18.041
From now on,

00:07:18.166 --> 00:07:19.583
I am Liu Gui.

00:07:20.875 --> 00:07:23.125
I'm going to sleep in my own bed.

00:07:23.125 --> 00:07:25.625
Think about what he's planning.

00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.083
What are you doing?

00:07:28.208 --> 00:07:28.958
Sir Li.

00:07:29.041 --> 00:07:30.791
We may not have much time left.

00:07:30.875 --> 00:07:31.916
Liu Qiaoqiao has already undergone corpse transformation.

00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.083
Why don't you give it a try too?

00:07:33.166 --> 00:07:34.458
You mean...

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.041
Tonight,

00:07:36.541 --> 00:07:38.041
you want me to sleep with you?

00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:39.541
Inside or outside, you choose.

00:07:39.583 --> 00:07:40.750
I'm not sleeping.

00:07:56.875 --> 00:07:58.500
Relax, Sir Li.

00:07:58.541 --> 00:07:59.416
Shut up.

00:08:51.208 --> 00:08:51.750
Shh.

00:08:51.833 --> 00:08:52.750
What's wrong?

00:08:52.833 --> 00:08:55.541
There's a ghost outside. It's about to come in.

00:09:24.208 --> 00:09:25.375
Sorry, Your Honor.

00:09:25.416 --> 00:09:27.583
My lady often wanders around at night.

00:10:16.625 --> 00:10:17.416
Luo Han

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.125
Did you find anything?

00:10:19.541 --> 00:10:22.375
Boss, there's nothing useful at all.

00:10:37.708 --> 00:10:38.583
Let me take a look.

00:10:41.375 --> 00:10:42.750
Using objects as vessels,

00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:44.458
can create the spirit of all things.

00:10:45.166 --> 00:10:46.583
Using people as vessels,

00:10:47.291 --> 00:10:49.000
is the way to immortality.

00:10:49.166 --> 00:10:50.875
It describes an esoteric art.

00:10:51.333 --> 00:10:53.708
It uses the corpse of a woman born at a yin hour as a vessel.

00:10:53.791 --> 00:10:56.291
It has miraculous effects on those with hidden ailments.

00:10:56.416 --> 00:10:58.833
That beast Liu Gui used the corpses of his adopted daughters

00:10:58.916 --> 00:11:00.250
to make a corpse bed.

00:11:00.916 --> 00:11:03.333
So that mortuary old man covered in sores

00:11:03.375 --> 00:11:04.833
had the same purpose.

00:11:05.083 --> 00:11:07.000
Killing to attain enlightenment.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.666
So, from this perspective,

00:11:11.583 --> 00:11:12.750
this isn't a ghost case.

00:11:13.083 --> 00:11:14.000
It's a human case.

00:11:14.625 --> 00:11:15.500
Charlatan.

00:11:16.125 --> 00:11:16.958
You lost.

00:11:17.208 --> 00:11:19.000
I'll notify the magistrate to arrest Liu Gui.

00:11:19.041 --> 00:11:19.791
Alright.

00:11:29.625 --> 00:11:30.583
What are you thinking about?

00:11:33.208 --> 00:11:35.166
This case is far from simple.

00:11:35.583 --> 00:11:37.916
I'm thinking about the mute girl who was spying last night.

00:11:38.333 --> 00:11:40.333
Maybe she was trying to tell us something.

00:11:43.083 --> 00:11:44.041
Where is she?

00:11:44.333 --> 00:11:45.958
I just saw her here.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.166
Boss, what's going on?

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:07.250
We were about to arrest Liu Gui,

00:12:07.333 --> 00:12:08.833
but someone killed him first.

00:12:08.875 --> 00:12:09.750
Could it be...

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.375
Did Liu Qiaoqiao really reanimate and kill him?

00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.208
Your Excellency,

00:12:14.916 --> 00:12:17.833
do you think this is a human case or a ghost case now?

00:12:23.708 --> 00:12:27.125
I can't believe Liu Gui was right under our noses.

00:12:28.625 --> 00:12:30.666
Your Excellency, what should we do next?

00:12:31.666 --> 00:12:34.291
How is the investigation on the mortuary old man?

00:12:34.541 --> 00:12:35.750
Reporting to Your Excellency,

00:12:36.125 --> 00:12:37.750
I found that the corpse watcher

00:12:37.833 --> 00:12:40.041
has been secretly seeking esoteric arts.

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:42.875
Trying every method to cure his skin disease.

00:12:44.041 --> 00:12:44.916
As expected.

00:12:45.041 --> 00:12:46.125
He and Liu Gui

00:12:46.208 --> 00:12:48.625
were practicing the same dark arts from that strange book.

00:12:49.333 --> 00:12:50.583
But Liu Gui,

00:12:51.875 --> 00:12:53.166
who killed him?

00:12:54.458 --> 00:12:55.416
I believe

00:12:55.458 --> 00:12:57.875
the coroner should examine Liu Gui's body carefully.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.625
To determine what hidden ailment Liu Gui had.

00:13:00.708 --> 00:13:03.416
That required using dark arts and a corpse bed to resolve.

00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:05.666
Understood.

00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.791
You may leave now. Let me think it over.

00:13:07.791 --> 00:13:08.291
Alright.

00:13:08.333 --> 00:13:08.958
By the way,

00:13:09.791 --> 00:13:11.458
Is your wife well lately?

00:13:13.375 --> 00:13:14.666
Thank you for your concern, Your Excellency.

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:16.875
My wife is doing well.

00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.583
Master, please come this way.

00:13:30.708 --> 00:13:32.916
Both of these people died tragically.

00:13:33.791 --> 00:13:36.125
Let me perform last rites for them.

00:13:43.166 --> 00:13:44.125
It seems

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.125
besides Liu Gui and the mortuary old man,

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.250
there's a third person obsessed with the dark arts in that book.

00:13:49.708 --> 00:13:52.083
Trying to attain enlightenment through corpses.

00:14:08.833 --> 00:14:10.041
Let me ask you something.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:12.791
That monk—

00:14:13.208 --> 00:14:15.666
Has he ever visited your residence before today?

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.291
I remember now.

00:14:21.375 --> 00:14:22.958
I saw him one night.

=Episode 9=

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.120
Hey.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.640
Two things. First...

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.480
De Jiu is gone.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.330
What?

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.640
She and Master tricked me
out of tuition,

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.230
then held me hostage, and just left?

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.740
Don't you want to be a wandering hero?

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.570
- You...
- Wandering heroes are like this.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.960
Second thing,

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.680
Lord Gong says there will be an exam?

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.710
Duke, don't worry.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.330
- The exam
- The exam?

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.040
is just a show
for the people of Chang'an.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.590
Besides, every man here is gifted.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.400
Shouldn't we let
the people of Chang'an see that?

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.280
Gifted.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.790
An exam is enough to prove it?

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:58.680
Of course.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.560
Aren't I the examiner?

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.920
When the time comes,

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.590
I'll set the questions nice and easy.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.850
The scores would naturally soar.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.360
The fairness of the exam

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.280
is just to silence the court.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.450
You understand?

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.830
Yes.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.820
I'll go prepare the questions.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.150
Wait for my word.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.270
Thanks.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:21.550
Duke.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.800
How's it going?

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:23.940
No need to ask that.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.520
Wang Heng is the examiner.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.890
How could there be any problem?

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.280
I've taken care of everything.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.630
Oh.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.140
(Longshan Inn, Examination Area)

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.120
Mathematics problems.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.430
A cage holds both chickens and rabbits.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.560
Look up,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.680
and you see 35 heads.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.280
Look down,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.710
and you see 94 feet.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.920
How many chickens

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.000
and how many rabbits are there?

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.870
These fowl and livestock
do reflect daily life,

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.820
but such rustic puzzles

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.270
hardly match the grand strategies
of the realm.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.590
Logic problems.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.750
There are four officials:
A, B, C, and D.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.910
Each comes from a different county.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.240
Here are four statements about them.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.630
Only two of them are true.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.410
First,

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.400
A comes from County A
and performs excellently.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.350
Second,

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.030
if B is from County B,

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.190
then he has made a mistake.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.190
Third,

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.180
C has made no mistake

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.270
and is not from County C.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.190
Fourth, D is from County D

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.310
and performs the worst.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.190
So, among these four statements,

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.750
which two are correct?

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.830
Lord Wang, please, stop.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.630
I'm all muddled now.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.080
Though an official must always discern
right from wrong,

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.840
this puzzle...

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.870
I understand.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.530
Logic questions don't concern the realm.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.320
Alright, fine.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:47.710
Let me handle it instead.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.910
Much obliged to you.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.580
Why can't I go in?

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.200
Ignore him; keep writing.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.120
Forgive me, Duke.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.520
Lord Wang has given instructions.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.750
This exam concerns
the selection of talents.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.430
It must be treated with utmost secrecy.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.680
So, when setting the questions,

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.780
the one drafting them
must be kept in isolation.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.270
No contact with outsiders is allowed.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.120
That won't do.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.080
I must see Wang Heng.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.710
Wang Heng, I know you're inside.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.400
You shameless rascal.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.200
Take it back.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.680
Lord Wang.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.360
The exam papers are ready.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.270
Very well, thanks, Lord Gong.

- Bushi.
- Alright.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.400
Yours.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.480
This is...

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.630
Why is it so much smaller?

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.020
Why is your font so big?

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.960
Just make do.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.560
It's all the same.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.220
Fine.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.720
Impressive, Duke.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:23.870
Should we memorize it all?

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.800
Yeah.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.130
What kind of scribbles are these?

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.430
What's this fork-shaped mark
supposed to mean?

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.270
Fork-shaped mark?

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.720
There are 23 chickens

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.150
and 12 rabbits.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.240
You don't get it?

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:42.560
Yeah.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.950
Well.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.630
There are 23 chickens

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.750
and 12 rabbits.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.000
Come on.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.080
Has your family ever raised
chickens or rabbits?

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.240
Oh.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.750
Why don't we just memorize them?

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.070
No need to overthink it.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.690
Yeah.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.070
Examiner, please organize the examinees
into the exam room.

present your badge and exam permit

Then receive an inspection.

(Longshan Inn)
Examinees must undergo the checks.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.240
Forbidden items can't be taken
into the exam room.

If you already have them,

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.560
you must place them
in the small belongings storage area.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:39.750
Once cleared,
you may proceed to the exam room.

- How did it go?

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:53.830
All good.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:54.950
- You?
- All good.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:55.800
And you?

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:56.680

Why are you going in there?

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.520
You go in first.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:02.800
It's alright.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:10.870

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.700
Examinees,
please listen to the question.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:53.150
Question one.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.200
Wang Heng.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.390
What is the way to secure
the nation's army?

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.150
Second question.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.600
Wan Zhang asked:

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.030
Baili Xi sold himself to a Qin merchant
for five sheep skins

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.270
to feed the cattle for the trust
of Duke Mu of Qin.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:07.440
Question:

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.200
What guidance have you got
on such matters today?

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:12.200
You impudent brat.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.220
(Examination Paper Seal)

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.300
(A)

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.420
(B)

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.090
The exam begins.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.240
Test Paper A and Test Paper B

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.270
are among the effective ways
to prevent cheating.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.670
In emergencies,
the spare Test Paper B will be used.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.600
This ensures
absolute foolproof security.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:12.910
Think carefully.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.320
Li Qi.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:17.560
Yes?

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.290
What does it mean?

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.080
Focus.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.160
Qingge.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:35.120
Qingge.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:38.630
Go back.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.330
What are you looking at?

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.370
What are you staring at?

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:57.910
Keep writing.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:06.440
The exam is over.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.220
Collect the papers.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.680
Hey.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:26.080
Lord Wang,
can the confinement be lifted now?

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:27.780
The confinement

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.720
for question setters lasts
until the exam ends.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.510
It's the custom in my hometown.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.350
Thanks, Lord Gong.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.520
Thanks, Reviewer.

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:36.700
We have both worked hard.

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:37.880
I shall take my leave.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:38.920
Take care.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:47.640
May I enter this time?

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.600
I know you're angry.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:57.960
But in time, you'll understand

00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:59.790
that it was for your good.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.000
All I know is that what you did

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.000
is not something a brother should do.

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:11.230
Duke.

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.230
This is the list of those
who passed the exam.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.550
These are

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.320
the results from yesterday.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.960
Apart from those whose names are read,

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:45.990
everyone else...

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Duke, this...

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.180
The rest have passed the assessment.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.000
Do you know what you're doing?

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.150
I poured my heart
into planning this exam,

00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:59.000
all because...

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
For the sake of brotherhood,
I'll spare you once.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.320
But I will not tolerate you
provoking me without restraint.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:06.780
Lord Gong, say something.

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:07.670
Lord Gong.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:09.550
Don't you enjoy being confined?

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:10.750
Lock Wang Heng away.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:12.630
Liu He, have you lost your mind?

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.040
Lord Gong.

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:15.790
Lord Gong.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.750
Zhao Han, Wang Wen.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:25.910
Li Chuang, Wu Jun.

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:27.240
Get inside.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.270
Li Ye, Liu Yudong, Wei Ping.

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:32.150
Yin Xiangwen, Zhang Qian.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.440
Lin Yuankai.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:34.420
Qian Hongxin.

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:36.070
These fifty will return to Changyi.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.760
The remaining two hundred,

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.200
follow me.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:40.590
We'll set out

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.300
for Chang'an at once.

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:44.830
Great!

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:57.340
(Longshan Inn, Dingtao, Changyi)

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.460
(Jiyang)

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.500
(Jiyang)

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.660
(Jiyang)

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:22.910
Still sulking, are you?

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.840
I'm not as petty as you.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:32.390
I don't hold grudges.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.160
Come on, open the door.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.040
Hey.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:45.510
Heng.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.210
Don't tell me you're getting used
to this prison cart.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.230
Does this give you that much joy?

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:52.950
I only locked you up for a while.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.390
Hardly a big deal.

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:55.600
You know exactly what I mean.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.920
I lead my 200 brothers to share
wealth and glory.

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:05.510
Why wouldn't I be happy?

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:07.870
Happy?

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.320
Is that it?

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:11.870
There's no greater joy than this.

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.420
But your greater joy will bring harm
to many more lives.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.280
Wang Heng.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.670
You just want to drive away my men

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:18.870
so you can charge ahead alone

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:19.710
and claim the Qilin?

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.750
If all of your men

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.630
were to die in Chang'an,

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.180
would you still be pleased?

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:30.860
I merely saw through your scheme,

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.910
yet you cursed my men

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.440
only for the Qilin?

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.320
Listen.

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:38.840
This is no curse.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:40.080
It's the Mandate of Heaven.

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:41.600
All of these men but you

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:43.600
will die

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:44.640
because of you.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.790
Wang, come on.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.080
(Chamberlain Gong
admonished the Duke)

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.320
(and had over 50 sent back.)

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:06.440
(The process was altered,)

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:08.010
(yet the outcome remained the same.)

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:09.820

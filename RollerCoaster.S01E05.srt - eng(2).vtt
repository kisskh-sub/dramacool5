WEBVTT

00:00:05.507 --> 00:00:07.306
Please divorce me, Lamp.

00:00:07.306 --> 00:00:09.307
I’ve been thinking about this too.

00:00:09.307 --> 00:00:11.206
Are you going to divorce?

00:00:11.206 --> 00:00:13.106
I’m trying to do so.

00:00:13.106 --> 00:00:15.007
Up until now,

00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:18.507
you’ve been trying, haven’t you?

00:00:18.507 --> 00:00:21.507
But it never happens!

00:00:21.507 --> 00:00:23.007
Hey!

00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:24.706
Where’s your necklace?

00:00:24.706 --> 00:00:29.406
Don’t tell me you gave it to someone special again?

00:00:29.406 --> 00:00:30.307
Loft,

00:00:30.307 --> 00:00:31.706
who are you dating?

00:00:31.706 --> 00:00:40.507
Do I know that person?

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:42.406
Did you have a fight with your mom?

00:00:42.406 --> 00:00:44.607
I can tell just by a sidelong glance

00:00:44.607 --> 00:00:47.207
that you aren’t in a good mood.

00:00:47.207 --> 00:00:49.007
Pure,

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:52.507
I’ve to marry him.

00:00:52.507 --> 00:00:54.406
I can’t let my dad’s business

00:00:54.406 --> 00:00:56.406
become worse.

00:00:56.406 --> 00:00:58.007
What about us?

00:00:58.007 --> 00:00:59.707
If I don’t do that,

00:00:59.707 --> 00:01:01.707
my mom and I are losing everything.

00:01:01.707 --> 00:01:02.707
So, you agree to marry

00:01:02.707 --> 00:01:04.507
someone you don’t love?

00:01:04.507 --> 00:01:07.407
For money?

00:01:07.407 --> 00:01:10.007
Okay. I’m getting married to him for money.

00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:12.507
Do you feel good now?

00:01:12.507 --> 00:01:13.407
I’m sorry.

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:15.007
I shouldn’t have said that.

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:17.507
I’m always the first for you, aren’t I?

00:01:17.507 --> 00:01:20.207
Pure,

00:01:20.207 --> 00:01:22.806
I’ve made a decision.

00:01:22.806 --> 00:01:25.407
No, I’m not okay.

00:01:25.407 --> 00:01:34.507
Air!

00:02:26.507 --> 00:02:27.807
You asked me to join drinking.

00:02:27.807 --> 00:02:29.307
But you don’t drink anything.

00:02:29.307 --> 00:02:33.807
Why don’t you stay at home instead?

00:02:33.807 --> 00:02:39.807
Or you just had an argument with Lamp before?

00:02:39.807 --> 00:02:42.407
No, it wasn’t Lamp.

00:02:42.407 --> 00:02:43.706
It was Pure instead.

00:02:43.706 --> 00:02:45.307
What happened?!

00:02:45.307 --> 00:02:47.507
The night before, when you slept over at my place,

00:02:47.507 --> 00:02:49.007
you looked worried.

00:02:49.007 --> 00:02:51.106
You didn’t share anything with me.

00:02:51.106 --> 00:02:53.407
I asked Pure to wait.

00:02:53.407 --> 00:02:56.307
She’s been waiting for you for so long, hasn’t she?

00:02:56.307 --> 00:03:00.307
I used to think like that.

00:03:00.307 --> 00:03:03.706
But when I seriously asked her.

00:03:03.706 --> 00:03:06.807
Pure isn’t good at hiding her feelings.

00:03:06.807 --> 00:03:09.407
When she’s pleased,

00:03:09.407 --> 00:03:10.407
down,

00:03:10.407 --> 00:03:11.807
sad,

00:03:11.807 --> 00:03:13.706
or happy,

00:03:13.706 --> 00:03:16.206
I can easily tell how she’s feeling.

00:03:16.206 --> 00:03:17.007
At that time,

00:03:17.007 --> 00:03:20.007
what could you see in her?

00:03:20.007 --> 00:03:22.606
She was pretending to be happy.

00:03:22.606 --> 00:03:25.007
Pretending to be happy?

00:03:25.007 --> 00:03:26.007
So, you’re telling me that

00:03:26.007 --> 00:03:27.507
she isn’t pleased

00:03:27.507 --> 00:03:30.706
after you’ve seriously asked her to wait?

00:03:30.706 --> 00:03:31.606
Why is that?

00:03:31.606 --> 00:03:35.407
Or has she got someone else already?

00:03:35.407 --> 00:03:37.706
I don’t know.

00:03:37.706 --> 00:03:41.206
Hey! The truth might not be that bad.

00:03:41.206 --> 00:03:42.307
She might be like …

00:03:42.307 --> 00:03:43.507
happy and

00:03:43.507 --> 00:03:44.706
surprised.

00:03:44.706 --> 00:03:49.407
She might be so surprised that she couldn’t say anything.

00:03:49.407 --> 00:03:53.807
You might get her wrong.

00:03:53.807 --> 00:03:57.007
No way.

00:03:57.007 --> 00:03:59.706
I’ve been with Pure for many years.

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:04.407
If there’s something wrong, I surely notice it.

00:04:04.407 --> 00:04:06.507
So, it can’t help.

00:04:06.507 --> 00:04:10.307
Although I told her not to wait anymore,

00:04:10.307 --> 00:04:15.007
I’ve been hurt, actually.

00:04:15.007 --> 00:04:17.406
It’s so painful, Bam.

00:04:17.406 --> 00:04:19.307
Air,

00:04:19.307 --> 00:04:22.307
I think you shouldn’t overthink now.

00:04:22.307 --> 00:04:23.007
So, what about this?

00:04:23.007 --> 00:04:25.007
To make it clear, you’d better ask her

00:04:25.007 --> 00:04:26.007
if she’s got someone else

00:04:26.007 --> 00:04:27.706
or not.

00:04:27.706 --> 00:04:28.706
If yes,

00:04:28.706 --> 00:04:31.607
who’s that person?

00:04:31.607 --> 00:04:33.307
It might hurt,

00:04:33.307 --> 00:04:44.406
but at least everything will be clear.

00:04:44.406 --> 00:04:45.307
Well. Ploy,

00:04:45.307 --> 00:04:46.906
please take care of the meeting minute,

00:04:46.906 --> 00:04:48.706
and the agency

00:04:48.706 --> 00:04:50.107
who’s been booking for Filipino customers.

00:04:50.107 --> 00:04:52.007
Also, the new building site inspection.

00:04:52.007 --> 00:04:53.607
The subcontractor is new to us,

00:04:53.607 --> 00:04:55.007
so I don’t feel very confident.

00:04:55.007 --> 00:04:55.906
Okay.

00:04:55.906 --> 00:04:57.406
I’ll take care of them.

00:04:57.406 --> 00:04:59.607
Alright.

00:04:59.607 --> 00:05:00.307
Anyway,

00:05:00.307 --> 00:05:01.507
thank you so much.

00:05:01.507 --> 00:05:03.507
In case of emergency, please ring me anytime.

00:05:03.507 --> 00:05:04.406
Sure.

00:05:04.406 --> 00:05:08.706
See you. Bye for now.

00:05:08.706 --> 00:05:11.406
Ooh!

00:05:11.406 --> 00:05:12.507
I want to know

00:05:12.507 --> 00:05:16.206
whether you regularly select a secretary by appearance?

00:05:16.206 --> 00:05:17.807
Don’t tell me that

00:05:17.807 --> 00:05:19.007
she is the one you’re dating, huh?

00:05:19.007 --> 00:05:20.507
No, not at all!

00:05:20.507 --> 00:05:21.906
She’s so smart that I’ve hired her.

00:05:21.906 --> 00:05:24.007
Don’t talk too much.

00:05:24.007 --> 00:05:24.807
Are you sure?

00:05:24.807 --> 00:05:29.507
Uh!

00:05:29.507 --> 00:05:31.406
Yeah, I talked to him last week,

00:05:31.406 --> 00:05:33.607
and he said the architect will come check out the site

00:05:33.607 --> 00:05:34.406
by the end of the month.

00:05:34.406 --> 00:05:36.206
But I think that's kind of late for summer, you know?

00:05:36.206 --> 00:05:39.206
'cause there'll be a lot of guests staying over.

00:05:39.206 --> 00:05:40.507
Bye. Bye.

00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:42.007
Seriously though.

00:05:42.007 --> 00:05:43.206
What?

00:05:43.206 --> 00:05:45.007
You’re this busy.

00:05:45.007 --> 00:05:46.706
Why do you need to come to Bangkok?

00:05:46.706 --> 00:05:48.206
I’m meeting my friend.

00:05:48.206 --> 00:05:50.007
A friend?

00:05:50.007 --> 00:05:52.507
Or a girlfriend?

00:05:52.507 --> 00:05:55.007
I’ve been longing to be more than a friend.

00:05:55.007 --> 00:05:57.206
But I’m waiting for the fortune.

00:05:57.206 --> 00:05:58.507
But at this time,

00:05:58.507 --> 00:06:00.406
it’s good enough for me.

00:06:00.406 --> 00:06:01.706
Well,

00:06:01.706 --> 00:06:02.706
do I know

00:06:02.706 --> 00:06:05.007
the one you’re talking about?

00:06:05.007 --> 00:06:09.307
I told you before you don’t know her.

00:06:09.307 --> 00:06:10.807
Well, I think I’m getting off here.

00:06:10.807 --> 00:06:12.307
Huh? You mean now?

00:06:12.307 --> 00:06:14.307
Umm. The traffic is bad.

00:06:14.307 --> 00:06:16.307
I’ll ride a sky train instead.

00:06:16.307 --> 00:06:17.507
See you at home.

00:06:17.507 --> 00:06:18.607
Bye. Bye.

00:06:18.607 --> 00:06:21.007
Well, please let me get off right in front over there.

00:06:50.607 --> 00:06:54.406
We don’t have a deposit service here.

00:06:54.406 --> 00:06:56.507
If you arrived here a little late,

00:06:56.507 --> 00:06:59.107
this would be thrown away.

00:06:59.107 --> 00:07:01.906
You’re so mean.

00:07:01.906 --> 00:07:04.507
Why are you back so early?

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:06.607
I couldn’t stand missing you.

00:07:06.607 --> 00:07:09.206
So, I hurriedly came back here.

00:07:09.206 --> 00:07:11.007
Why do you work hard like this,

00:07:11.007 --> 00:07:15.307
Miss Studio Owner.

00:07:15.307 --> 00:07:16.406
By the way,

00:07:16.406 --> 00:07:18.307
you’ve been traveling frequently like this,

00:07:18.307 --> 00:07:20.906
don’t you feel tired?

00:07:20.906 --> 00:07:23.206
Not seeing you in person

00:07:23.206 --> 00:07:26.406
is more tiring.

00:07:26.406 --> 00:07:28.607
We haven’t met for a long time.

00:07:28.607 --> 00:07:31.507
Don’t you miss me?

00:07:31.507 --> 00:07:35.507
Uh.

00:07:35.507 --> 00:07:37.406
I somehow miss you.

00:07:37.406 --> 00:07:38.206
Ooh!

00:07:38.206 --> 00:07:41.906
Somehow?

00:07:41.906 --> 00:07:44.507
Without the word ‘somehow’, please.

00:07:44.507 --> 00:07:46.507
Please.

00:07:54.706 --> 00:07:59.906
I miss you.

00:07:59.906 --> 00:08:01.706
Will you need a hug?

00:08:01.706 --> 00:08:04.007
How could you know what I want?

00:08:04.007 --> 00:08:06.007
So smart.

00:08:12.307 --> 00:08:16.007
Will you leave right away?

00:08:16.007 --> 00:08:16.706
Umm.

00:08:16.706 --> 00:08:17.706
I finished working.

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:21.507
I’m going home.

00:08:21.507 --> 00:08:22.206
Oh!

00:08:22.206 --> 00:08:23.507
Can I go with you?

00:08:24.507 --> 00:08:27.607
Are you asking for permission to visit my place?

00:08:27.607 --> 00:08:31.007
Or are you going to sleep over with me?

00:08:31.007 --> 00:08:32.607
Well, you’d better consider this situation.

00:08:32.607 --> 00:08:34.707
Will you let me go back home alone

00:08:34.707 --> 00:08:37.007
and be lonely in my bedroom by myself?

00:08:37.007 --> 00:08:39.507
I think it’s unfair.

00:08:39.507 --> 00:08:40.507
Umm.

00:08:40.507 --> 00:08:44.306
Okay. A night for you.

00:08:44.306 --> 00:08:45.007
Wow!

00:09:05.406 --> 00:09:07.207
If one day,

00:09:07.207 --> 00:09:10.007
Air and Lamp are divorcing,

00:09:10.007 --> 00:09:14.707
so, I must have to disappear, right?

00:10:27.943 --> 00:10:29.542
What are you doing?

00:10:34.743 --> 00:10:37.643
I just helped take your shoes off.

00:10:42.643 --> 00:10:46.542
What are you thinking about?

00:10:46.542 --> 00:10:51.643
Nothing.

00:10:51.643 --> 00:10:54.542
I’m okay if you think about it.

00:10:54.542 --> 00:10:57.743
Because I also thought about it.

00:10:57.743 --> 00:10:58.542
Well,

00:10:58.542 --> 00:10:59.943
you’d better wash your hands

00:10:59.943 --> 00:11:01.743
for hygiene.

00:11:01.743 --> 00:11:04.643
The restroom’s over there. Go!

00:11:59.342 --> 00:12:01.342
Can I take a bath with you?

00:16:48.743 --> 00:16:51.642
Are you awake?

00:16:51.642 --> 00:16:53.442
Uh.

00:16:53.442 --> 00:16:55.243
Well, I’ve to go.

00:16:56.743 --> 00:16:58.243
Next time, if you’re busy,

00:16:58.243 --> 00:17:02.243
you don’t have to come.

00:17:02.243 --> 00:17:05.642
Do you want something to eat?

00:17:05.642 --> 00:17:07.142
No, thank you.

00:17:07.142 --> 00:17:09.243
You can go back to sleep.

00:17:10.743 --> 00:17:11.743
I’m okay.

00:17:11.743 --> 00:17:13.043
I’ll make something for you to eat.

00:17:13.043 --> 00:17:15.743
It doesn’t take too long.

00:17:33.243 --> 00:17:35.942
Your pyjamas aren’t proper, you know?

00:17:35.942 --> 00:17:37.142
I’m at home.

00:17:37.142 --> 00:17:39.642
I can wear whatever.

00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:43.942
Aren’t you afraid I won’t be able to take it anymore?

00:17:43.942 --> 00:17:45.043
I’m not afraid at all

00:17:45.043 --> 00:17:47.243
as you must hold yourself back.

00:17:52.243 --> 00:17:53.243
Thank you.

00:17:53.243 --> 00:17:56.243
When you are home safely, let me know.

00:18:01.142 --> 00:18:04.142
Are you okay?

00:18:04.142 --> 00:18:08.343
I’m alright.

00:18:08.343 --> 00:18:10.743
You’re not a professional liar.

00:18:10.743 --> 00:18:12.542
If you don’t want to tell me,

00:18:12.542 --> 00:18:15.943
that’s fine.

00:18:15.943 --> 00:18:17.042
I just feel

00:18:17.042 --> 00:18:19.743
a little bit sad

00:18:19.743 --> 00:18:21.743
that when I see you,

00:18:21.743 --> 00:18:25.243
I can be with you only for a short time and then leave.

00:18:25.243 --> 00:18:27.142
If possible,

00:18:27.142 --> 00:18:29.343
I’d want to be with you much longer.

00:18:29.343 --> 00:18:30.943
When are you coming back again?

00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:33.743
Maybe, next week.

00:18:33.743 --> 00:18:35.743
But I’ll

00:18:35.743 --> 00:18:38.343
come and see you first.

00:18:38.343 --> 00:18:40.042
Ahem!

00:18:40.042 --> 00:18:42.743
Don’t you plan to go back to your own home?

00:18:42.743 --> 00:18:45.443
The house is always there.

00:18:45.443 --> 00:18:49.542
But if it’s you here, I’m not sure.

00:18:49.542 --> 00:18:51.443
If one day,

00:18:51.443 --> 00:18:56.042
Air and Lamp are divorcing.

00:18:56.042 --> 00:18:58.243
So, I must disappear, right?

00:19:03.943 --> 00:19:08.943
Will you feel sad?

00:19:08.943 --> 00:19:12.743
Sure, I will.

00:19:12.743 --> 00:19:16.042
But you don’t have to worry about me.

00:19:22.042 --> 00:19:24.642
VIP guests are checking in this evening.

00:19:24.642 --> 00:19:27.943
I’ve to leave now to get things ready to welcome them.

00:19:27.943 --> 00:19:31.042
See you next week.

00:19:31.042 --> 00:19:32.243
Uh.

00:19:32.243 --> 00:19:34.243
See you.

00:19:37.743 --> 00:19:40.743
You’ve discussed this with the latest supplier, right?

00:19:43.243 --> 00:19:44.743
Well, Miss Air.

00:19:44.743 --> 00:19:47.243
Miss Juthamas would like to see you here.

00:19:49.042 --> 00:19:51.243
You came back from the trip for a long time.

00:19:51.243 --> 00:19:52.542
What have you been up to?

00:19:52.542 --> 00:19:54.142
I’ve called you many times.

00:19:54.142 --> 00:19:57.243
Lamp was bothered with your absence.

00:20:00.042 --> 00:20:01.943
How was it?

00:20:01.943 --> 00:20:03.943
Any updates?

00:20:03.943 --> 00:20:05.642
What are you asking about?

00:20:05.642 --> 00:20:09.943
You know what I meant.

00:20:09.943 --> 00:20:12.142
Well,

00:20:12.142 --> 00:20:14.343
we’re not ready to have a kid.

00:20:14.343 --> 00:20:16.343
You’re getting older and older.

00:20:16.343 --> 00:20:19.443
Having a kid when you’re old is risky and tiring, you know?

00:20:19.443 --> 00:20:20.743
Yes, I know.

00:20:20.743 --> 00:20:23.343
You guys have been married for many years.

00:20:23.343 --> 00:20:25.042
Are you sure

00:20:25.042 --> 00:20:27.743
you’ve been a good wife?

00:20:30.542 --> 00:20:33.443
If you’re talking about producing a kid,

00:20:33.443 --> 00:20:35.142
I failed, then.

00:20:35.142 --> 00:20:36.743
Stop being sarcastic!

00:20:36.743 --> 00:20:38.542
Don’t you think Lamp is pitiful?

00:20:38.542 --> 00:20:40.243
Why are you so selfish?

00:20:40.243 --> 00:20:42.542
Am I selfish? Are you sure?

00:20:47.642 --> 00:20:49.142
Is that all

00:20:49.142 --> 00:20:52.142
that you’re here for?

00:20:52.142 --> 00:20:55.042
How many times have we talked about this?

00:20:55.042 --> 00:20:57.243
It’s you who chose Lamp.

00:20:57.243 --> 00:20:59.243
Or it was you, Mom

00:20:59.243 --> 00:21:01.443
who forced me to choose!

00:21:03.943 --> 00:21:04.943
I think

00:21:04.943 --> 00:21:07.343
we shouldn’t talk about this anymore.

00:21:07.343 --> 00:21:10.642
If there’s nothing else,

00:21:10.642 --> 00:21:11.943
I think you might want to leave.

00:21:11.943 --> 00:21:13.943
Don’t you get smart with me!?

00:21:13.943 --> 00:21:16.042
The dependent person who needs family support like you

00:21:16.042 --> 00:21:18.243
must watch your words!

00:21:18.243 --> 00:21:19.943
For your whole life,

00:21:19.943 --> 00:21:22.142
you’ve never faced any difficulties

00:21:22.142 --> 00:21:24.142
because of me. Don’t you remember?

00:21:24.142 --> 00:21:25.642
Without Lamp’s support,

00:21:25.642 --> 00:21:28.542
your dad’s unsuccessful business

00:21:28.542 --> 00:21:30.943
would have put us in a homeless status.

00:21:30.943 --> 00:21:32.642
Well, it wasn’t me

00:21:32.642 --> 00:21:35.743
who caused the bankrupted business.

00:21:35.743 --> 00:21:37.343
I’ve to be responsible for everything

00:21:37.343 --> 00:21:39.343
right here right now.

00:21:39.343 --> 00:21:42.142
Isn’t it enough?

00:21:42.142 --> 00:21:44.142
I don’t know.

00:21:44.142 --> 00:21:48.443
You’ve no choice. You’ve to do what I want.

00:21:48.943 --> 00:21:51.542
Mom,

00:21:51.542 --> 00:21:54.243
I’ve something to tell you.

00:22:01.243 --> 00:22:02.243
You need to apologize to him.

00:22:02.243 --> 00:22:03.943
Don’t let this happen.

00:22:03.943 --> 00:22:06.642
What if he wouldn’t give any financial support to us.

00:22:06.642 --> 00:22:07.743
No, Mom.

00:22:07.743 --> 00:22:08.642
I’m ready for anything.

00:22:08.642 --> 00:22:10.743
But it’s about your future.

00:22:10.743 --> 00:22:12.443
Or your own future, Mom?

00:22:12.443 --> 00:22:13.542
Air!

00:22:13.542 --> 00:22:15.142
No! No! No!

00:22:15.142 --> 00:22:16.042
No way!

00:22:16.042 --> 00:22:17.743
I can’t let it end like this.

00:22:30.943 --> 00:22:31.743
Yes, Miss Air.

00:22:31.743 --> 00:22:32.642
Kat, please.

00:22:32.642 --> 00:22:34.443
Cancel all the afternoon meetings

00:22:34.443 --> 00:22:36.443
of mine.

00:22:36.443 --> 00:22:37.943
I don’t feel well.

00:22:37.943 --> 00:22:41.843
Err. But …

00:22:41.843 --> 00:22:47.243
Do you have anything to tell me?

00:22:47.243 --> 00:22:48.443
Well, nothing.

00:22:48.443 --> 00:22:50.542
I’ll manage it right now.

00:23:05.243 --> 00:23:07.443
Oh! Hello.

00:23:07.443 --> 00:23:08.743
Long time no see.

00:23:08.743 --> 00:23:10.042
Are you here to meet Pure?

00:23:10.042 --> 00:23:10.943
Right.

00:23:10.943 --> 00:23:12.542
Here you are.

00:23:12.542 --> 00:23:14.042
I brought you your favorites.

00:23:14.042 --> 00:23:16.443
Oh! Thank you so much.

00:23:16.443 --> 00:23:18.042
Can you wait a minute?

00:23:18.042 --> 00:23:19.443
Pure’s finishing up soon.

00:23:19.443 --> 00:23:21.743
No problem.

00:23:21.743 --> 00:23:23.243
Well, this should be alright.

00:23:23.243 --> 00:23:24.743
With this wrist position.

00:23:24.743 --> 00:23:27.243
With this degree.

00:23:49.743 --> 00:23:52.142
Did you have a fight with your mom?

00:23:52.142 --> 00:23:56.142
I can guess.

00:23:56.142 --> 00:23:59.243
Are you comforting me?

00:24:16.333 --> 00:24:17.133
Why can you be here

00:24:17.133 --> 00:24:19.833
at this time?

00:24:19.833 --> 00:24:21.933
Don’t you have to work?

00:24:21.933 --> 00:24:23.433
I skipped work.

00:24:23.433 --> 00:24:24.933
Huh?

00:24:24.933 --> 00:24:27.433
Are you serious?

00:24:27.433 --> 00:24:31.033
Skipping work?

00:24:31.033 --> 00:24:36.033
Is there something wrong?

00:24:36.033 --> 00:24:39.332
Can I just see you without a reason?

00:24:39.332 --> 00:24:41.433
Did you have a fight with your mom?

00:24:41.433 --> 00:24:47.033
I can guess.

00:24:47.033 --> 00:24:51.232
Are you comforting me?

00:24:51.232 --> 00:24:55.433
What’s it about?

00:24:55.433 --> 00:24:57.433
There’s nothing much.

00:25:05.433 --> 00:25:09.232
How can I comfort you

00:25:09.232 --> 00:25:12.433
as we can’t do

00:25:12.433 --> 00:25:19.433
what we used to do.

00:25:19.433 --> 00:25:22.433
I’m sorry

00:25:22.433 --> 00:25:25.433
for making everything

00:25:25.433 --> 00:25:35.433
so complicated.

00:25:35.433 --> 00:25:42.133
Air,

00:25:42.133 --> 00:25:43.933
that’s fine.

00:25:54.933 --> 00:25:59.433
Pure,

00:25:59.433 --> 00:26:03.433
For the divorce,

00:26:03.433 --> 00:26:11.433
Soon it will be over.

00:26:11.433 --> 00:26:15.433
Lamp’s going to divorce me.

00:26:15.433 --> 00:26:21.433
You forced him, I know.

00:26:21.433 --> 00:26:22.433
Mom,

00:26:22.433 --> 00:26:24.433
Lamp has dignity

00:26:24.433 --> 00:26:26.433
and he can make a decision for his life too.

00:26:26.433 --> 00:26:27.433
Because you don’t behave,

00:26:27.433 --> 00:26:29.433
he’s going to divorce you,

00:26:29.433 --> 00:26:31.433
right?

00:26:31.433 --> 00:26:32.433
But everything we’ve done

00:26:32.433 --> 00:26:34.433
is for your future.

00:26:34.433 --> 00:26:36.433
Air,

00:26:36.433 --> 00:26:38.433
listen to me.

00:26:38.433 --> 00:26:39.433
You must apologize to him.

00:26:39.433 --> 00:26:43.433
You’ve to make him change his mind.

00:26:43.433 --> 00:26:45.433
Don’t you feel embarrassed?

00:26:45.433 --> 00:26:46.433
You’ve just got married,

00:26:46.433 --> 00:26:48.433
but you are asked for a divorce.

00:26:48.433 --> 00:26:49.132
If he wants to completely end the relationship with you,

00:26:49.132 --> 00:26:49.933
and quit all financial support,

00:26:49.933 --> 00:26:50.933
how can we survive?

00:26:50.933 --> 00:26:52.933
No, Mom.

00:26:52.933 --> 00:26:54.433
I’m done.

00:26:54.433 --> 00:26:56.433
But it’s for your future.

00:26:56.433 --> 00:26:58.433
Or it’s for your own future, Mom?

00:26:58.433 --> 00:27:01.433
Air!

00:27:01.433 --> 00:27:03.433
Mom, please listen to me.

00:27:03.433 --> 00:27:04.933
You don’t have to worry about the financial matter.

00:27:04.933 --> 00:27:06.933
I’ll talk to Lamp.

00:27:06.933 --> 00:27:07.933
I’ll ask him to support you

00:27:07.933 --> 00:27:09.933
as usual.

00:27:09.933 --> 00:27:11.433
Mom,

00:27:11.433 --> 00:27:14.433
if we had nothing left,

00:27:14.433 --> 00:27:16.433
I wouldn’t leave you behind.

00:27:16.433 --> 00:27:18.433
Mom, please don’t panic.

00:27:18.433 --> 00:27:20.433
No! No! No!

00:27:20.433 --> 00:27:21.433
No way!

00:27:21.433 --> 00:27:28.433
I can’t let it end like this.

00:27:28.433 --> 00:27:45.433
What else can you do, Mom?

00:27:45.433 --> 00:27:51.433
If I get divorced,

00:27:51.433 --> 00:27:55.433
I’ll be asking

00:27:55.433 --> 00:27:59.433
if you’d like to be with me.

00:27:59.433 --> 00:28:02.433
You know well

00:28:02.433 --> 00:28:06.433
I’ve been waiting for you.

00:28:06.433 --> 00:28:09.433
Yes, I know.
70
But the last time we talked about this

00:28:13.433 --> 00:28:15.433
you were different.

00:28:15.433 --> 00:28:16.433
Well,
73
if I divorce him

00:28:19.433 --> 00:28:21.433
one day,

00:28:21.433 --> 00:28:24.433
and you change your mind,

00:28:24.433 --> 00:28:29.433
just let me know.

00:28:29.433 --> 00:28:34.433
If I’ve someone else,

00:28:34.433 --> 00:28:44.433
will it be okay for you?

00:28:44.433 --> 00:28:53.433
So, you do have someone now, don’t you?

00:28:53.433 --> 00:28:57.433
Am I right?

00:28:57.433 --> 00:29:01.433
Someone who has been your happiness

00:29:01.433 --> 00:29:06.433
when I’m not here for you.

00:29:06.433 --> 00:29:11.433
Is it my fault?

00:29:11.433 --> 00:29:14.433
It’s you who told me

00:29:14.433 --> 00:29:17.433
not to wait for you.

00:29:17.433 --> 00:29:20.433
But actually,

00:29:20.433 --> 00:29:35.433
no one can replace you.

00:29:35.433 --> 00:29:39.433
You don’t have to give me a final answer now.

00:29:39.433 --> 00:29:44.433
But I want you to know

00:29:44.433 --> 00:29:49.433
up until now

00:29:49.433 --> 00:29:55.433
I’ve had only you in my heart.

00:29:55.433 --> 00:29:58.433
But you know what?

00:29:58.433 --> 00:30:01.433
Actions speak louder than words.

00:30:23.433 --> 00:30:25.433
I just asked you out to have an easy meal.

00:30:25.433 --> 00:30:28.433
Why do you need those heels and be this beautiful?

00:30:28.433 --> 00:30:29.332
I’ve changed my mind.

00:30:29.332 --> 00:30:30.832
It’s fashionable.

00:30:30.832 --> 00:30:34.832
I’ll eat here instead.

00:30:34.832 --> 00:30:37.033
Well, I’ve been here before.

00:30:37.033 --> 00:30:37.733
Sure.

00:30:37.733 --> 00:30:40.832
I took you to the pub over there once.

00:30:40.832 --> 00:30:41.733
I mean I’d been here before that night.

00:30:41.733 --> 00:30:48.832
I’ve been here with …

00:30:48.832 --> 00:30:50.832
Why did you arrive faster this time?

00:30:50.832 --> 00:30:53.832
You drove fast, huh?

00:30:53.832 --> 00:30:55.832
No, it’s normal.

00:30:55.832 --> 00:30:56.832
Or …

00:30:56.832 --> 00:30:57.832
it’s my physical body

00:30:57.832 --> 00:31:00.832
hurriedly wanting to see you.

00:31:00.832 --> 00:31:01.832
It’s dangerous.

00:31:01.832 --> 00:31:04.832
Are you worried about me?

00:31:04.832 --> 00:31:05.832
Sure.

00:31:05.832 --> 00:31:06.832
In case of emergency,

00:31:06.832 --> 00:31:09.832
your sister …

00:31:10.832 --> 00:31:12.832
If you want to continue mentioning Air,

00:31:12.832 --> 00:31:14.832
I’m fine.

00:31:14.832 --> 00:31:16.832
But

00:31:16.832 --> 00:31:17.832
before Air

00:31:17.832 --> 00:31:21.832
hadn’t you been in a relationship with anyone?

00:31:21.832 --> 00:31:22.832
Uh.

00:31:22.832 --> 00:31:25.832
No, it’s my 5-year relationship with Air.

00:31:25.832 --> 00:31:29.832
So, it’s hard to quit.

00:31:29.832 --> 00:31:31.832
I’m sorry that

00:31:31.832 --> 00:31:33.832
I’ve missed some of you calls.

00:31:33.832 --> 00:31:36.832
So, we haven’t talked often.

00:31:36.832 --> 00:31:37.832
I’ve been

00:31:37.832 --> 00:31:38.832
a bit busy.

00:31:38.832 --> 00:31:44.832
We aren’t in that serious relationship, I know.

00:31:44.832 --> 00:31:46.832
Well,

00:31:46.832 --> 00:31:51.832
are you sleeping over at my place tonight?

00:31:51.832 --> 00:31:55.832
I’m afraid not.

00:31:55.832 --> 00:31:57.832
After the meal,

00:31:57.832 --> 00:32:00.832
I’m going home to see my family.

00:32:00.832 --> 00:32:01.832
Whenever I’m in Bangkok,

00:32:01.832 --> 00:32:04.832
they hardly see me in person.

00:32:04.832 --> 00:32:06.832
I thought you’d avoid meeting me.

00:32:06.832 --> 00:32:10.832
Like what you’ve done? Avoiding me?

00:32:10.832 --> 00:32:11.832
Hey!

00:32:11.832 --> 00:32:13.832
Why do you always twist things around?

00:32:13.832 --> 00:32:16.832
Well, are you going to finishing the whole fried pork by yourself?

00:32:16.832 --> 00:32:17.832
You don’t eat it, anyway.

00:32:17.832 --> 00:32:19.832
How do you know I don’t eat it?

00:32:19.832 --> 00:32:23.832
By appearance, it just looks plain.

00:32:27.832 --> 00:32:28.832
Hey!

00:32:28.832 --> 00:32:29.832
How come? It’s so yummy!

00:32:29.832 --> 00:32:30.832
I told you.

00:32:30.832 --> 00:32:32.832
But you can only have one.

00:32:32.832 --> 00:32:34.832
The rest is mine.

00:32:34.832 --> 00:32:36.832
You didn’t order an extra for me.

00:32:36.832 --> 00:32:37.832
Pure!

00:32:37.832 --> 00:32:38.332
It’s mine.

00:32:38.332 --> 00:32:39.832
Hey, you’ve got 3 dishes already.

00:32:39.832 --> 00:32:40.832
I’ve only one.

00:32:40.832 --> 00:32:42.832
You can order more.

00:32:42.832 --> 00:32:45.832
Oh! You stole mine.

00:33:12.832 --> 00:33:13.433
Are you busy at work?

00:33:13.433 --> 00:33:15.832
Huh.

00:33:15.832 --> 00:33:17.832
It’s okay, Dad.

00:33:17.832 --> 00:33:21.832
Why isn’t Air here with you?

00:33:21.832 --> 00:33:24.832
She’s busy with her work now.

00:33:24.832 --> 00:33:25.832
Lamp,

00:33:25.832 --> 00:33:27.832
I think

00:33:27.832 --> 00:33:28.633
you’d better have Air

00:33:28.633 --> 00:33:29.832
stop working.

00:33:29.832 --> 00:33:31.133
Only taking care of household matters

00:33:31.133 --> 00:33:32.832
is too much.

00:33:32.832 --> 00:33:34.832
As a man,

00:33:34.832 --> 00:33:35.832
you shouldn’t

00:33:35.832 --> 00:33:37.832
let your beloved wife

00:33:37.832 --> 00:33:38.832
work too hard.

00:33:38.832 --> 00:33:39.832
Alright, Dad.

00:33:39.832 --> 00:33:41.832
Because of working hard,

00:33:41.832 --> 00:33:43.832
Air’s stressed,

00:33:43.832 --> 00:33:44.832
and she isn’t fit for having a kid.

00:33:44.832 --> 00:33:46.832
Uh.

00:33:46.832 --> 00:33:47.133
Well,

00:33:47.133 --> 00:33:47.832
Another thing,

00:33:47.832 --> 00:33:49.832
I think

00:33:49.832 --> 00:33:51.832
our family and Air’s

00:33:51.832 --> 00:33:52.832
have been in a long-lasting relationship

00:33:52.832 --> 00:33:54.832
and our businesses

00:33:54.832 --> 00:33:56.832
need the next generation to take care of them.

00:33:56.832 --> 00:33:59.832
ถ้ายังขืนใช้ชีวิตเรื่อยเปื่อยแบบเนี้ย If you guys live like this,

00:33:59.832 --> 00:34:00.832
it might be too late.

00:34:00.832 --> 00:34:08.832
Well, Dad, I don’t think things can be easily like what you’ve thought.

00:34:08.832 --> 00:34:12.832
I’ve made a decision

00:34:12.832 --> 00:34:15.832
that I’m divorcing Air.

00:34:15.832 --> 00:34:17.832
What happened?

00:34:17.832 --> 00:34:19.832
If you guys have problems,

00:34:19.832 --> 00:34:22.832
you’d better talk to each other.

00:34:22.832 --> 00:34:27.832
The problem is

00:34:27.832 --> 00:34:30.832
Air has never loved me, Mom.

00:34:30.832 --> 00:34:32.832
What do you mean?

00:34:32.832 --> 00:34:34.832
You’ve been married for many years.

00:34:34.832 --> 00:34:35.832
But she’s just known she doesn’t love you?

00:34:35.832 --> 00:34:37.832
It’s not Air’s fault.

00:34:37.832 --> 00:34:38.832
But why now?

00:34:38.832 --> 00:34:42.832
It’s …

00:34:42.832 --> 00:34:44.832
Dad, you’ve told me

00:34:44.832 --> 00:34:48.832
that a man mustn’t hurt a woman.

00:34:48.832 --> 00:34:49.832
I can’t hurt Air’s feelings

00:34:49.832 --> 00:34:52.832
any longer, Dad.

00:34:52.832 --> 00:34:54.832
I’m so sorry, Dad and Mom

00:34:54.832 --> 00:35:09.832
that I disappointed you.

00:35:09.832 --> 00:35:13.832
Well, since things have come this far,

00:35:13.832 --> 00:35:15.832
you’ve to manage everything properly.

00:35:15.832 --> 00:35:16.832
You should know

00:35:16.832 --> 00:35:18.832
what you should do.

00:35:18.832 --> 00:35:24.832
You’re mature. You’re a man.

00:35:24.832 --> 00:35:26.832
I agree with Dad.

00:35:26.832 --> 00:35:31.832
Take care of everything.

00:35:31.832 --> 00:35:33.832
Don’t let it be too long.
215
If not,

00:35:34.832 --> 00:35:40.832
you both will be more depressed.

00:35:40.832 --> 00:35:52.832
Okay, Mom.

00:35:52.832 --> 00:35:54.832
I know everything.

00:35:54.832 --> 00:35:57.832
What is it about?!

00:35:57.832 --> 00:36:00.832
About you and Pure!

00:36:34.848 --> 00:36:36.348
Why are you back so early?

00:36:36.348 --> 00:36:37.848
I thought you’re sleeping over

00:36:37.848 --> 00:36:39.649
at your parents’ place.

00:36:39.649 --> 00:36:42.048
Well, it’s because

00:36:42.048 --> 00:36:44.848
I’ve something to talk to you.

00:36:44.848 --> 00:36:50.149
Sure.

00:36:50.149 --> 00:36:53.948
I’ve made a decision.

00:36:53.948 --> 00:37:02.249
We’re going to divorce.

00:37:02.249 --> 00:37:08.948
Lamp,

00:37:08.948 --> 00:37:11.448
Well, as we’re going to completely separate,

00:37:11.448 --> 00:37:13.149
I’d like to sleep here. Can I?

00:37:19.248 --> 00:37:22.849
I’ve told my parents about the decision.

00:37:22.849 --> 00:37:24.849
What did they say?

00:37:24.849 --> 00:37:26.448
They’re okay.

00:37:26.448 --> 00:37:27.649
They didn’t complain about it.

00:37:31.049 --> 00:37:34.649
Are they welcoming another daughter?

00:37:37.649 --> 00:37:39.948
I also told my mom

00:37:39.948 --> 00:37:42.149
that you were asking me for a divorce.

00:37:42.149 --> 00:37:44.349
But for my mom,

00:37:44.349 --> 00:37:46.149
it might take a long time

00:37:46.149 --> 00:37:48.149
to make her believe

00:37:48.149 --> 00:37:51.849
that you want to divorce me.

00:37:51.849 --> 00:37:55.448
Loft’s known this already.

00:37:55.448 --> 00:37:57.349
She’s in Bangkok?

00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:58.849
Um.

00:37:58.849 --> 00:38:03.649
Well, …

00:38:03.649 --> 00:38:05.149
Huh?

00:38:16.149 --> 00:38:20.149
Did you eat anything?

00:38:20.149 --> 00:38:21.549
Not yet.

00:38:21.549 --> 00:38:22.949
After leaving the office,

00:38:22.949 --> 00:38:24.049
I came straight home.

00:38:24.049 --> 00:38:24.848
Do you want something to eat?

00:38:24.848 --> 00:38:26.649
I’ll make it for you.

00:38:26.649 --> 00:38:27.949
Lamp,

00:38:27.949 --> 00:38:29.049
you can cook, really?

00:38:29.049 --> 00:38:30.449
No, I can’t,

00:38:30.449 --> 00:38:32.949
but I’m the best at preparing instant noodles. Don’t you know?

00:38:32.949 --> 00:38:34.348
That’s the only thing

00:38:34.348 --> 00:38:35.848
I can show off to others.

00:38:35.848 --> 00:38:37.649
The only thing I can claim is that I’m better than Loft, anyway.

00:38:46.949 --> 00:38:49.848
Why are you smiling.

00:38:49.848 --> 00:38:51.348
Nothing,

00:38:51.348 --> 00:38:53.149
You should wait at the table.

00:38:53.149 --> 00:38:54.949
I’ll serve you when it’s ready.

00:38:54.949 --> 00:38:56.649
Uh.

00:39:01.649 --> 00:39:04.649
Oh,

00:39:04.649 --> 00:39:06.949
The work from the office.

00:39:06.949 --> 00:39:08.149
Oh!

00:39:08.149 --> 00:39:10.649
Alright.

00:40:03.949 --> 00:40:05.049
Place your arm next to your ear.

00:40:05.049 --> 00:40:08.649
Bend your body to the left.

00:40:08.649 --> 00:40:10.649
Okay.

00:40:10.649 --> 00:40:13.949
If Air comes back to Pure,

00:40:13.949 --> 00:40:15.549
and then?

00:40:15.549 --> 00:40:17.848
What should I do?

00:40:17.848 --> 00:40:19.248
Things are changing.

00:40:19.248 --> 00:40:20.449
Is it real?

00:40:25.949 --> 00:40:27.848
Loft, you’ve a coming call.

00:40:27.848 --> 00:40:29.649
Are you answering the call?

00:40:29.649 --> 00:40:31.048
No, I’m not.

00:40:31.048 --> 00:40:32.048
Let it be.

00:40:32.048 --> 00:40:33.649
It will stop shortly.

00:40:35.949 --> 00:40:37.848
Or you can take a break.

00:40:37.848 --> 00:40:39.048
It’s okay.

00:40:39.048 --> 00:40:41.348
Or shall I stop seeing Pure?

00:40:41.348 --> 00:40:43.249
Sigh! What should I do?

00:40:43.249 --> 00:40:45.348
Why do I have to stop?

00:40:45.348 --> 00:40:46.548
I feel about Pure

00:40:46.548 --> 00:40:48.048
the same way as Air does.

00:40:48.048 --> 00:40:50.149
Ooh! Loft, are you okay?

00:40:50.149 --> 00:40:51.249
Are you alright?

00:40:51.249 --> 00:40:52.348
I’m okay.

00:40:52.348 --> 00:40:54.348
I think it should be enough for today.

00:40:54.348 --> 00:40:55.449
Well, I’m taking …

00:40:55.449 --> 00:40:56.548
some ice for relieving the pain.

00:40:56.548 --> 00:40:57.249
Thank you.

00:40:57.249 --> 00:40:58.149
Slowly.

00:40:59.149 --> 00:41:00.149
Ouch!

00:41:00.149 --> 00:41:01.449
I’m sorry.

00:41:01.449 --> 00:41:02.449
Ow! That’s alright.

00:41:02.449 --> 00:41:04.649
I was overthinking about something else.

00:41:09.649 --> 00:41:12.149
Your new girlfriend’s kept calling.

00:41:12.149 --> 00:41:13.949
Yes.

00:41:13.949 --> 00:41:15.048
Your new girlfriend’s name

00:41:15.048 --> 00:41:17.149
is Ploy?

00:41:17.149 --> 00:41:18.048
Oh!

00:41:18.048 --> 00:41:20.649
She’s my secretary.

00:41:20.649 --> 00:41:22.649
Oh.

00:41:22.649 --> 00:41:24.048
Well, Loft.

00:41:24.048 --> 00:41:25.048
What?

00:41:25.048 --> 00:41:31.048
You’ve known Lamp’s divorcing me, right?

00:41:31.048 --> 00:41:32.149
Yes.

00:41:32.149 --> 00:41:35.649
Lamp told me already.

00:41:35.649 --> 00:41:37.949
I’m having a meeting today.

00:41:37.949 --> 00:41:39.649
I’ve to go now.

00:41:39.649 --> 00:41:41.449
If it swells,

00:41:41.449 --> 00:41:42.348
tell me. Okay?

00:41:42.348 --> 00:41:43.649
I’m taking you to hospital.

00:41:43.649 --> 00:41:44.449
Okay.

00:41:44.449 --> 00:41:45.848
Don’t worry!

00:41:45.848 --> 00:41:47.649
Thank you for your care.

00:41:47.649 --> 00:41:49.048
No problem.

00:41:49.048 --> 00:41:50.348
Now, Loft you can continue putting ice on it.

00:41:50.348 --> 00:41:53.449
Thank you.

00:41:53.449 --> 00:41:54.649
I’ve to leave now.

00:41:54.649 --> 00:41:56.149
Umm.

00:42:03.149 --> 00:42:04.149
What's the matter, huh?

00:42:04.149 --> 00:42:04.949
Ouch!

00:42:04.949 --> 00:42:07.149
Why did you stare at her like that?

00:42:07.149 --> 00:42:08.949
Anything interesting?

00:42:08.949 --> 00:42:10.949
She looks obviously happy, and it’s not normal.

00:42:10.949 --> 00:42:13.949
I also noticed skin-ship and touching.

00:42:13.949 --> 00:42:17.149
You’re divorcing, aren’t you?

00:42:17.149 --> 00:42:19.249
Because of the divorce,

00:42:19.249 --> 00:42:23.149
she seems to have less concern.

00:42:23.149 --> 00:42:24.649
Sigh! Well,

00:42:24.649 --> 00:42:27.449
are you really okay?

00:42:27.449 --> 00:42:30.149
Uh.

00:42:30.149 --> 00:42:32.949
Maybe, it’s the best thing for her.

00:42:37.949 --> 00:42:40.249
I’ve known about it.

00:42:40.249 --> 00:42:43.249
What is it about?

00:42:43.249 --> 00:42:44.649
About you and Pure!

00:43:03.149 --> 00:43:04.649
Air doesn’t know about this, does she?

00:43:04.649 --> 00:43:05.848
Not yet.

00:43:05.848 --> 00:43:08.649
But Air’s free now.

00:43:08.649 --> 00:43:10.848
Loft, you’d better think about this carefully.

00:43:10.848 --> 00:43:13.548
Between the one she’s been waiting for for more than 3 years,

00:43:13.548 --> 00:43:16.348
and the newcomer who she’s known for several months,

00:43:16.348 --> 00:43:18.649
whom is she going to choose?

00:43:32.149 --> 00:43:35.649
Are you going to sleep over here?

00:43:35.649 --> 00:43:37.848
Can I?

00:43:37.848 --> 00:43:40.649
Sure.

00:43:55.649 --> 00:43:57.649
Let me be here with you, please.

00:43:57.649 --> 00:43:58.949
Loft,

00:43:58.949 --> 00:44:00.649
what happened?

00:44:00.649 --> 00:44:03.649
I just wanted to be beside you like this

00:44:03.649 --> 00:44:05.649
until the end.

00:44:05.649 --> 00:44:08.649
Loft!

00:44:08.649 --> 00:44:11.649
I know well you still love Air.

00:44:11.649 --> 00:44:15.449
But I also love you.

00:44:15.449 --> 00:44:18.249
But being like this

00:44:18.249 --> 00:44:20.649
is good enough for me.

00:44:20.649 --> 00:44:21.649
I mean it.

00:44:23.649 --> 00:44:25.649
Loft!

00:44:51.649 --> 00:44:55.149
You kissed me while I was sleeping?

00:44:55.149 --> 00:44:58.149
I can’t forgive it.

00:44:58.149 --> 00:44:59.649
You aren’t okay.

00:44:59.649 --> 00:45:03.149
What will you do then?

00:45:03.149 --> 00:45:05.649
What about this?

00:45:09.948 --> 00:45:11.649
Are you hungry?

00:45:11.649 --> 00:45:14.448
I’ll cook you something to eat downstairs.

00:45:14.448 --> 00:45:16.249
Umm.

00:45:16.249 --> 00:45:17.448
Maybe not. I’m fine.

00:45:17.448 --> 00:45:21.649
We can go downstairs together.

00:45:38.649 --> 00:45:41.649
What are you looking at?

00:45:41.649 --> 00:45:43.149
Are you embarrassed?

00:45:43.149 --> 00:45:44.649
I’ve seen everything clearly.

00:45:44.649 --> 00:45:47.649
Naughty!

00:45:53.649 --> 00:45:55.649
What?!

00:45:55.649 --> 00:45:57.649
Nothing.

00:45:57.649 --> 00:46:00.649
Are you going downstairs to eat?

00:46:00.649 --> 00:46:02.649
Okay. I’m hungry now, Chef!

00:46:02.649 --> 00:46:05.149
Well, let me go then.

00:46:05.149 --> 00:46:05.948
No.

00:46:05.948 --> 00:46:06.948
I’ve changed my mind.

00:46:06.948 --> 00:46:07.948
What?

00:46:07.948 --> 00:46:09.649
I’ll have you instead.

00:46:11.149 --> 00:46:12.149
Come on!

00:46:17.149 --> 00:46:18.149
It’s my turn.

00:47:23.649 --> 00:47:25.149
What happened, Loft?

00:47:25.149 --> 00:47:27.149
I’ve just thought that

00:47:27.149 --> 00:47:29.649
if you went back to Air,

00:47:29.649 --> 00:47:31.448
how could I survive?

00:47:31.448 --> 00:47:32.649
Loft!

00:47:32.649 --> 00:47:34.149
I miss you.

00:47:34.149 --> 00:47:35.649
So do I.

00:47:35.649 --> 00:47:37.649
I’ve missed you

00:47:37.649 --> 00:47:39.149
always.

00:47:39.149 --> 00:47:42.149
Until that person came in, right?

00:47:42.149 --> 00:47:44.649
Why do I have to choose?

haven’t fulfilled,

08:45.458 --> 08:46.708
Why new boons again?

08:46.833 --> 08:49.208
Looks like Goddess Aparna is angered.

08:50.000 --> 08:56.791

Tell me to whom I still owe a boon.

<i>Hey!</i>
We got a great fruit.

10:28.666 --> 10:32.333
<i>Thinna, you never stop.</i>
We got a ripe fruit!

I hit it for him. Give it to Kethu.

Jingora Jinga.

10:45.666 --> 10:48.375
<i>- Thinna, my chain!</i>
- What happened, Kethu?

10:56.708 --> 10:58.916
<i>Let’s go to the carnival!</i>
Hurry up! It’s starting!

11:06.291 --> 11:08.333
Shambhaa...

11:08.458 --> 11:12.750
Shambha. Shambha. Shambha!

11:12.875 --> 11:15.666
<i>Shambha. Shambha. Shambha!</i>
Goddess possessed again.

11:16.375 --> 11:20.458
<i>Maremma madam!</i>
What is The Goddess saying?

11:20.833 --> 11:26.916
<i>Mother asks that we sacrifice</i>
one person to end the deaths in our hamlet.

11:27.125 --> 11:32.083
<i>Mother says to let go a hundred lives</i>
in return for one sacrifice.

11:32.166 --> 11:33.458
Another human sacrifice?

11:33.541 --> 11:38.583
<i>Hey! I think you mean, we will return</i>
the life Devi gave him back to her?

11:38.958 --> 11:42.124
Do you want Devi’s wrath or her blessings?

11:42.125 --> 11:44.458
Blessings, Mother.

11:44.500 --> 11:46.666
<i>In the sacrificial temple</i>
of Bijja bali: thunga!

11:46.833 --> 11:49.707

Sacrifice!

Bless us, mother!

11:51.541 --> 11:54.333
Thunga! Thunga!

11:54.500 --> 11:56.416
Look! This is the eye ammori.

11:57.208 --> 12:03.000
<i>Whoever this eye catches</i>
a glimpse of must be sacrificed.

12:03.250 --> 12:06.333
It’s been the ritual for generations.

12:07.208 --> 12:09.291
Goddess!

12:09.541 --> 12:11.041
Goddess!

12:14.041 --> 12:16.333
<i>- Thinna! -What?</i>
- Stop, man.

12:18.458 --> 12:22.291
<i>- Shambha... Shambha...</i>
- Have Mercy Mother! I beg you at your feet.

12:22.791 --> 12:28.958
<i>I can't watch my son being sacrificed.</i>
Instead, kill me and give him life.

12:29.250 --> 12:30.208
Stop...

12:31.125 --> 12:33.041
His life is no longer his.

12:34.083 --> 12:38.000
<i>He will be sacrificed for the sake</i>
of the village. Let go!

12:38.291 --> 12:44.125
Sacrifice. Sacrifice. Sacrifice...

12:46.333 --> 12:47.541
Kethu...

12:47.958 --> 12:53.958
Sacrifice. Sacrifice. Sacrifice...

12:55.458 --> 12:58.458
Father! What are they doing to Kethu?

12:58.875 --> 13:03.375
<i>Your mother fell victim to the fever</i>
that spread throughout the village.

13:03.791 --> 13:07.500
<i>We believe this sacrifice</i>
will help stop the dying.

13:07.750 --> 13:09.333
Show respect.

13:09.458 --> 13:12.000
Sacrifice? You mean they’ll kill Kethu?

13:17.208 --> 13:19.000
Shambha...

13:19.666 --> 13:20.708
<i>- Thinna...</i>
- Thinna, stop!

13:21.583 --> 13:22.500
Kethu!

13:23.166 --> 13:27.541
Sacrifice... Sacrifice... Sacrifice...

13:29.250 --> 13:34.375
Sacrifice... Sacrifice... Sacrifice...

13:34.833 --> 13:38.916
Sacrifice... Sacrifice... Sacrifice...

13:39.291 --> 13:41.666
<i>- Kethu!</i>
- Sacrifice... Sacrifice...

13:44.833 --> 13:50.791
Shambha... Shambha... Shambha...

13:51.833 --> 13:57.333
Shambha... Shambha... Shambha...

14:01.916 --> 14:06.083
Shambha... Shambha... Shambha...

14:15.208 --> 14:21.208
This is not God. It’s nothing but a rock!

14:21.625 --> 14:22.916
Only stone!

14:25.208 --> 14:26.833
There’s no God, father.

14:26.958 --> 14:28.500
<i>- That’s just a stone.</i>
- Thinna stop!

14:29.875 --> 14:31.916
<i>- There’s no God.</i>
- Thinna...

14:32.750 --> 14:36.041
<i>- That’s just a stone.</i>
- Thinna stop! Wait!

14:48.083 --> 14:55.916
<i>Mother... You said that</i>
God saves people's lives.

14:56.125 --> 15:02.458
<i>What's that, mother?</i>
He took away Kethu’s life.

15:02.833 --> 15:06.791
<i>There is no God, Ma.</i>
It’s just a stone.

15:07.958 --> 15:09.416
It’s just a stone.

15:14.208 --> 15:16.916
Thinna... Thinna...

15:17.375 --> 15:19.500
Don’t say that Thinna. It’s wrong.

15:20.250 --> 15:23.541
<i>You can speak against humans</i>
but not against God.

15:23.958 --> 15:28.500
<i>There’s no God, Father.</i>
If he were here I would kill him!

15:29.166 --> 15:30.291
I would kill him!

15:30.666 --> 15:32.291
No, Thinna...

15:38.625 --> 15:40.375
Why are you so happy, God of gods?

15:40.791 --> 15:43.916
He threw a stone, not a bilva leaf.

15:44.166 --> 15:47.208
<i>When he thinks of me</i>
and throws even a stone...

15:47.625 --> 15:50.916
<i>that feels like a bilva leaf</i>
for me, Bhavani.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.875
<i>You think an atheist like him</i>
is going to worship you?

15:54.375 --> 15:56.083
Change is part of nature, Devi.

15:56.958 --> 16:03.125
<i>I know Thinnadu exists,</i>
and eventually he’ll realize I do too.

16:04.666 --> 16:09.166
<i>Look at the stone thrown</i>
by Thinna in anger, Devi.

16:31.833 --> 16:32.958
My cutie...

16:42.375 --> 16:47.333
<i>Help! My baby!</i>
An eagle carried off my baby!

16:48.958 --> 16:50.625
Please help!

16:52.833 --> 16:54.041
My baby!

17:00.375 --> 17:01.375
Thinna.

17:23.583 --> 17:25.833
Hey! Thinna.

17:53.750 --> 17:54.500
Thinna!

17:57.625 --> 17:58.583
My baby!

18:00.583 --> 18:04.291
<i>Here! Your child is safe.</i>
Don't you worry.

18:06.166 --> 18:09.041
<i>You restored my child</i>
and my life to me, Thinna.

18:09.833 --> 18:12.166
<i>- You are a god to us!</i>
- No! Not that! -Ganga!

18:19.208 --> 18:23.458
Ammoru saved your child, not Thinnadu.

18:24.833 --> 18:27.208
I, a human, saved its life.

18:27.833 --> 18:30.250
<i>If it were up to that rock,</i>
we would’ve had to give him a sacrifice.

18:30.708 --> 18:34.875
<i>I will protect all children.</i>
That’s my vow!

18:36.458 --> 18:37.541
Thinnadu's vow!

18:58.083 --> 19:01.875
<i>- Chief! -Yes!</i>
- Tell us tales of Thinnadu.

19:01.958 --> 19:03.791
Listen, I’ll tell.

19:04.625 --> 19:05.958
His birth is a story all its own.

19:06.583 --> 19:09.125
<i>Mother Forest, his teacher,</i>
taught him the art of the hunt.

19:09.708 --> 19:12.125
<i>His vision seems ordinary,</i>
like any of ours,

19:12.500 --> 19:15.208
but it is keen and sharp.

19:15.666 --> 19:21.000
<i>He went to pick mountain flowers...</i>
on his way back, he encountered a tiger.

19:24.083 --> 19:26.958
<i>Thinna was just six years old,</i>
but he wasn’t scared.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.750
He picked up a nearby spear.

19:30.250 --> 19:31.500
The tiger stared at him.

19:31.583 --> 19:32.666
Thinnadu returned the gaze.

19:32.875 --> 19:36.416
<i>Just before the tiger pounced,</i>
he thrust the spear into as into

19:36.666 --> 19:38.333
a mound of red clay.

19:38.541 --> 19:42.875
<i>That was all it took—the spear</i>
sank right into the tiger's throat.

19:45.333 --> 19:49.500
<i>So, I made a bow for him out of</i>
a rib from the tiger he’d slain.

19:51.166 --> 19:54.583
<i>I crafted arrows from the horns</i>
of a spotted deer.

19:56.083 --> 19:59.583
<i>His hunt started in childhood,</i>
and still continues.

19:59.791 --> 20:05.458
<i>Sir! How many times will you bore</i>
them with the same tale every day?

20:05.833 --> 20:07.416
<i>How many times will you</i>
repeat the same story?

20:08.291 --> 20:11.083
<i>Your story always feels fresh</i>
no matter how many times I tell it.

20:11.250 --> 20:12.041
Yes.

20:12.250 --> 20:14.583
<i>That's fine, let’s go to sleep.</i>
It’s already late in the night.

20:14.791 --> 20:16.083
Just one more little story.

20:16.291 --> 20:17.791
<i>- Father, let's go.</i>
- Mallu, you tell.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.125
Ok, move on!

20:21.083 --> 20:23.916
<i>We got to narrate such warriors'</i>
tales to the children.

20:27.625 --> 20:29.750
Why are we not getting anyt hunt today?

20:29.875 --> 20:31.458
You take that side and I’ll go here.

20:31.541 --> 20:32.708
<i>- Ok?</i>
- OK!

22:39.875 --> 22:42.125
<i>Who are you?</i>
I don’t think you’re from our Village.

22:43.166 --> 22:45.666
Don’t just stand there like a tree trunk.

22:46.458 --> 22:48.333
Can’t you speak?

22:49.208 --> 22:51.666
Deaf? Arrogant?

22:52.166 --> 22:54.875
<i>Nemali, I caught a rabbit!</i>
Come see!

23:07.166 --> 23:09.166
Thinna, I bagged the deer!...

23:10.208 --> 23:10.958
Thinna!

23:12.500 --> 23:13.458
Thinna!

23:13.791 --> 23:14.708
What’s with you?

23:15.125 --> 23:20.125
<i>A stunning girl captivated me.</i>
She appeared and then vanished.

23:23.791 --> 23:28.000
<i>Disappeared, means...</i>
Probably a ghost!

23:30.083 --> 23:31.666
My Lovely Ghost.

23:35.916 --> 23:38.583
<i>Who are you?</i>
Why are you coming without permission?

23:38.625 --> 23:39.625
What’s all this bending?

23:39.875 --> 23:42.583
<i>What is it like to be welcomed with swords by the teacher?</i>
Isn't that strange?

23:42.708 --> 23:43.541
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

23:44.208 --> 23:45.333
Who are you people?

23:45.541 --> 23:53.125
<i>We are the worthies who have come from the</i>
banks of Swarnamukhi river to civilize you...

23:53.500 --> 23:54.291
Oh!

23:54.458 --> 23:57.416
<i>We came here on the invitation</i>
of this Hamlet’s Queen.

23:57.666 --> 24:01.583
Honored gentlemen, greetings.

24:01.791 --> 24:02.708
Greetings...

24:03.000 --> 24:05.833
<i>This is my colleague,</i>
Srimaan chowdeshwarappa garu.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.416
<i>And my colleague,</i>
Sriyutha kankubatteswara garu.

24:12.083 --> 24:14.791
Masters, This is our daughter, Nemali.

24:19.791 --> 24:22.500
<i>Nemali. Why did you cover</i>
yourself with so much ash?

24:22.750 --> 24:25.291
Do you stroll the graveyard like Shiva?

24:25.791 --> 24:28.541
Who said Shiva wanders graveyards?

24:28.791 --> 24:31.750
Again with your smart mouth.

24:31.833 --> 24:33.666
Why do I have to keep telling you?

24:33.875 --> 24:38.916
<i>For 27 generations our family</i>
has been the leaders of our clan.

24:39.208 --> 24:41.708
We wield the sword.

24:42.458 --> 24:48.583
<i>If you walk around worshipping Shiva like this,</i>
what will happen to our power?

24:50.041 --> 24:52.458
Shiva gave us the power, right?

24:54.291 --> 24:56.000
See masters?

24:57.750 --> 25:02.166
<i>She goes around wearing devotion</i>
on her sleeve,

25:02.708 --> 25:06.458
<i>Bring down her devotion,</i>
enhance leadership qualities and

25:06.500 --> 25:11.125
<i>make her into a greatest leader</i>
of all these hamlets.

25:12.541 --> 25:13.541
Not a problem.

25:14.125 --> 25:19.166
<i>We trained the Lion in leadership</i>
and now he’s the king of the forest.

25:20.916 --> 25:27.291
<i>Then I charge you to transform</i>
my daughter into a princess.

25:27.500 --> 25:28.916
As you wish, so be it.

25:31.458 --> 25:33.666
Teachers, don’t listen to my mother.

25:34.208 --> 25:36.750
I dream of the Vayulingam every night.

25:37.250 --> 25:38.541
Can you show it to me?

25:38.625 --> 25:39.666
Madness, girl.

25:40.541 --> 25:44.416
<i>The Vayulingam is guarded</i>
by the Bhadraganas.

25:44.541 --> 25:46.875
Regular folks can’t just drop in for a visit.

25:46.958 --> 25:48.750
Mister MahadevaShastri.

25:51.750 --> 25:53.875
The very embodiment of Lord Shiva.

25:57.583 --> 25:59.833
Blessed by Parameshwara.

26:03.291 --> 26:06.500
<i>Wise scholar.</i>
Foremost authority on the four Vedas.

26:09.875 --> 26:12.791
<i>When he bows his head and prays,</i>
he is Kalahastheeswara.

26:15.708 --> 26:17.708
<i>When he lifts his head</i>
he is the fearsome Kalabhairava.

26:21.916 --> 26:26.250
<i>He alone is the supreme one</i>
watches over Vayulingam.

26:35.333 --> 26:37.208
<i>“Dama Dama Dama Dama –</i>
Vishwalingaa”

26:37.416 --> 26:39.375
<i>“Dhimi Dhimi Dhimi Dhimi –</i>
Visfu Lingaa”

26:39.541 --> 26:41.583
<i>“Damadama Damadama –</i>
Abhayalingaa”

26:41.791 --> 26:44.416
<i>“Dhimi Dhimi Dhimi Dhimi –</i>
Aathmalingaa”

26:53.041 --> 26:55.083
<i>“Over there he stands,</i>
Mahadeva Shastri”

26:55.291 --> 26:57.250
<i>“Right here he is,</i>
Mahadeva Shastri”

26:57.416 --> 26:59.625
<i>“He awakens –</i>
at Brahma's gentle touch”

26:59.791 --> 27:02.500
<i>“The forest awakens –</i>
under his gaze”

27:08.250 --> 27:12.416
<i>“His forehead adorned with</i>
Shiva's divine touch”

27:12.625 --> 27:16.833
“This Shiva contemplates deeply”

27:17.041 --> 27:21.333
<i>“To the rhythmic Damaruka</i>
beats in his heart”

27:21.500 --> 27:25.791
<i>“This Shiva (Hata Yogi)</i>
listens intently”

27:30.958 --> 27:32.750
<i>“When he closes his eyelid –</i>
he becomes fierce Shastri”

27:32.958 --> 27:35.165
<i>“When he opens his third eye –</i>
he transforms into destructive “

27:35.166 --> 27:37.499
<i>“He is the pillar of faith</i>
and aspiration”

27:37.500 --> 27:40.041
<i>“With the reflection of</i>
Shaiva gracing his countenance”

27:44.291 --> 27:46.208
<i>“When he closes his eyelid –</i>
he becomes fierce Shastri”

27:46.416 --> 27:48.500
<i>“When he opens his third eye –</i>
he transforms into destructive “

27:48.708 --> 27:50.666
<i>“He is the pillar of faith</i>
and aspiration”

27:50.875 --> 27:53.875
<i>“With the reflection of</i>
Shaiva gracing his countenance”

28:10.958 --> 28:15.000
“Om Namah Shivaya”

28:17.625 --> 28:21.833
“Om Namah Shivaya”

28:22.125 --> 28:26.208
<i>"How sublime, how mysterious</i>
form of Vayulingam”

28:26.666 --> 28:30.625
<i>“You have granted me alone</i>
the opportunity to touch you”

28:30.833 --> 28:33.333
<i>“Shivam resides in the Sun</i>
and the Moon”

28:35.083 --> 28:37.708
<i>“Shivam flows through</i>
the nine nerves”

28:39.583 --> 28:41.458
“Shivam permeates the Earth”

28:41.666 --> 28:43.833
<i>“Shivam stretches across</i>
the vast sky”

28:44.041 --> 28:48.833
<i>“Sound of the waves of Ganga descending</i>
to touch you, resonates as Shivam”

28:50.833 --> 28:54.625
<i>“You embody the form of</i>
the boundless Skyland”

28:55.166 --> 28:59.166
<i>“You serve as the foundation for</i>
all living forms upon this Earth”

28:59.583 --> 29:03.416
<i>“The form of Shiva encompasses</i>
the entire universe”

29:13.458 --> 29:16.375
Sharvaya! Bhavaya!

29:17.291 --> 29:18.583
Thrinethraya!

29:19.458 --> 29:26.333
<i>Neelakantaaya! Bhasmangaraagaaya!</i>
Namasshivaya!

29:27.916 --> 29:33.208
<i>Jagadhbhurandharaa!</i>
Salutes to the Pranalingam.

29:34.666 --> 29:37.791
<i>Here in the glorious Mrityunjaya</i>
holy land where you, the first Ordained,

29:38.000 --> 29:42.332
<i>gave life-giving alms to the young</i>
Markandeyu and made him...

29:42.333 --> 29:43.791
one of the seven immortals.

29:44.916 --> 29:50.208
<i>Your breath on Kailasa peak is the same</i>
as blows through this southern Kailasa.

29:51.500 --> 29:56.750
<i>Our family, descendants of the Agasthya clan,</i>
were entrusted to perform the Shiva ritual.

29:57.833 --> 30:04.208
<i>This Vayulingam, the great secret of Shiva,</i>
must not be discovered by outsiders.

30:04.416 --> 30:05.958
I will not allow it to be desecrated.

30:06.291 --> 30:08.041
I will not permit blasphemous acts.

30:08.375 --> 30:10.000
I vowed this to my father.

30:12.250 --> 30:15.583
<i>As a witness to the Vedic verses delivered</i>
by the Goddess of the Vedas, Mata Gayatri.

30:16.333 --> 30:19.250
I swear on my sacred thread.

30:20.916 --> 30:26.500
<i>I will sacrifice any life to preserve</i>
the glory of this Vayulingam,

30:27.000 --> 30:29.125
even offer up my own.

30:29.333 --> 30:30.375
Auspicious Shiva!

30:31.750 --> 30:33.458
Auspicious Rudra.!

30:46.625 --> 30:47.708
What is it, Tikki?

30:47.916 --> 30:50.750
<i>The other day, you followed close</i>
on Mali’s horse’s swaying tail.

30:50.958 --> 30:53.500
<i>Yesterday, you poked around</i>
Shivangi's horse.

30:53.708 --> 30:55.791
<i>What is this behavior?</i>
You can’t stop yourself?

30:56.000 --> 30:57.750
How many horse lovers do you need?

30:57.833 --> 30:58.958
One should be enough.

31:00.041 --> 31:01.833
Just as my lovely Ghost would be for me.

31:04.625 --> 31:05.541
Don’t be upset.

31:06.083 --> 31:09.750
<i>I myself saw her only that once.</i>
Next time I’ll introduce you.

31:17.666 --> 31:18.375
Oi.

31:19.375 --> 31:20.916
How do we get to the Vayulingam?

31:22.000 --> 31:23.333
You’re going to that brick?

31:23.625 --> 31:25.208
<i>What nuthouse of a land did</i>
you escape from?

31:25.250 --> 31:26.500
What do need that rock for?

31:26.666 --> 31:29.333
<i>We have something important to do.</i>
Please tell how to get there.

31:30.083 --> 31:32.875
<i>Straight through the forest,</i>
you’ll see four hamlets...

31:32.916 --> 31:34.541
<i>you’ll come to the Swarnamukhi</i>
river.

31:34.916 --> 31:39.000
<i>Bhadhraganam, guards of the lingam,</i>
will show up and tell you the rest.

31:44.625 --> 31:48.375
<i>Hey Sivangi, does your mother Maremma</i>
know about your love with Maali?

31:48.458 --> 31:50.208
Oh no, she'd kill if known.

31:50.875 --> 31:51.791
Here, have water.

32:02.833 --> 32:05.541
<i>The journey from a long distance</i>
has made us quite thirsty.

32:05.791 --> 32:07.333
<i>Can you give us something to</i>
quench our thirst?

32:07.625 --> 32:08.458
All yours, Chief.

32:09.625 --> 32:12.291
<i>To quench this thirst,</i>
a pot of water won’t do.

32:12.708 --> 32:14.625
<i>We need the body of</i>
one of your mountain folk.

32:29.333 --> 32:30.040
Get back here!

32:30.041 --> 32:31.375
<i>- Run for your lives!</i>
- Sieze them!

32:31.416 --> 32:33.708
Let me go!

32:35.333 --> 32:36.500
Hey, catch guys.

33:00.333 --> 33:01.083
Hey!

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
Hey!

35:09.791 --> 35:11.041
Hey!

35:23.416 --> 35:24.416
Hey!

35:32.916 --> 35:33.916
Hey!

35:46.250 --> 35:47.125
Hey!

36:08.958 --> 36:10.208
Hey!

36:24.208 --> 36:25.583
He escaped. Let go!

36:27.125 --> 36:30.083
<i>Who are these people?</i>
I’ve never seen them around here!

36:36.500 --> 36:39.458
<i>Do you have any idea</i>
whose people you killed?

36:39.791 --> 36:40.916
My brother is on his way.

36:40.958 --> 36:42.041
And who’s he supposed to be?

36:42.208 --> 36:43.500
Kalamukhudu...

36:43.958 --> 36:48.291
Kala... Kala... Kala...

36:48.416 --> 36:53.291
Kala... Kala... Kala...

36:53.625 --> 36:58.125
<i>My brother Kalamukha is no mere man.</i>
He is Yama, Lord of Death.

37:04.250 --> 37:09.458
Kala... Kala... Kala...

37:09.833 --> 37:14.583
Kala... Kala... Kala...

37:21.916 --> 37:24.333
<i>Hey! Only fifty of us have arrived yet,</i>
you see.

37:24.416 --> 37:28.750
<i>If we’d carried and taken the Vayulingam,</i>
you might have stood a chance.

37:29.375 --> 37:30.916
But now, my brother’s coming.

37:31.125 --> 37:37.958
<i>He’ll come with an army of hundreds,</i>
thousands, even lakhs and ruin all your hamlets.

37:40.541 --> 37:43.166
He'll take away Vayulingam.

37:43.333 --> 37:47.500
<i>His army will decapitate your men</i>
before your eyes...

37:48.000 --> 37:53.000
<i>and subject every woman</i>
to brutal suffering.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.250
We're dead if Kalamukha arrives.

38:05.166 --> 38:06.250
Have no fear.

38:07.291 --> 38:08.541
Lord Vishnu in the form of Varaha...

38:09.166 --> 38:12.958
<i>the boar rescued the Earth Goddess Bhudevi</i>
from the demon...

38:13.291 --> 38:15.833
<i>since then,</i>
we have dwelt in peace in this forest.

38:16.916 --> 38:22.166
<i>No bandits or troublemakers</i>
have dared encroach on us.

38:22.333 --> 38:25.541
<i>Good they don’t attack by Goddess’s grace.</i>
What if they attack?

38:25.666 --> 38:28.875
<i>They’re an army of thousands.</i>
What can we do, Chief?

38:29.416 --> 38:31.791
<i>Let them come in millions.</i>
We’ll end them.

38:33.458 --> 38:36.500
Spear-throwing is not as easy as talk.

38:39.458 --> 38:43.083
<i>To win the war, we need to perform</i>
rituals for the Goddess.

38:43.166 --> 38:46.375
If not, she'd sip everyone's blood dry.

38:46.666 --> 38:48.125
We will be left with corpses.

38:49.166 --> 38:51.500
Maremma is right about one thing.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.041
Everyone would die.

38:55.666 --> 38:57.958
But, how we died doesn't matter.

38:58.583 --> 39:01.625
<i>It’s the cause for which we die</i>
that gives our lives value.

39:02.833 --> 39:09.582
<i>If we can truly win using pumpkins and</i>
lemons, why use arrows and axes?

39:09.583 --> 39:11.375
Who says we need to raise an army?

39:12.291 --> 39:15.375
<i>A single lion can overcome</i>
ten wild elephants.

39:16.291 --> 39:18.958
<i>We have the power to vanquish</i>
such a lion with just a single arrow.

39:19.916 --> 39:24.166
<i>We are untamed, and each of us</i>
as fearsome as a hundred lions.

39:25.375 --> 39:27.333
You all just say yes for the war.

39:28.166 --> 39:31.208
<i>I’ll take the vanguard.</i>
My aim is to kill at least a thousand.

39:32.125 --> 39:36.750
<i>Not thousands, let them come in Lakhs.</i>
Let's fight.

39:37.500 --> 39:40.333
And that’s my vow. Thinnadu's vow.

39:41.458 --> 39:44.458
<i>She gathers lemons...</i>
burns the pumpkins.

39:44.583 --> 39:45.833
And that’s how she expects us to win.

39:45.916 --> 39:48.166
<i>The real suffering in this village</i>
is due to no one but Maremma.

39:48.916 --> 39:53.375
<i>You always come to your mother's</i>
side you're upset, Thinnaa .

39:54.583 --> 40:00.041
<i>Thinnaa. We’ve followed this tradition</i>
for generations. Pay Devi respect.

40:00.416 --> 40:02.083
You know my feelings about that stuff.

40:02.458 --> 40:03.333
I know.

40:04.041 --> 40:07.666
<i>That’s why I never pressed</i>
my belief in God on.

40:08.125 --> 40:09.625
You’re free to believe as you will.

40:09.791 --> 40:14.000
<i>But there’s nothing wrong in</i>
respecting other's beliefs.

40:14.833 --> 40:18.166
<i>I can't perform a ritual I detest</i>
and don’t believe in, father.

40:19.250 --> 40:22.125
<i>I can't withstand saying as belief</i>
when a mistake is being done.

40:23.041 --> 40:25.833
I don’t have the strength.

40:26.916 --> 40:28.083
Please, just have some of this.

40:28.708 --> 40:29.666
I don’t want it.

40:29.875 --> 40:33.000
Just take it. Please.

40:41.166 --> 40:45.666
<i>To battle Kalamukha, Thinna,</i>
the five clans have to work together.

40:46.125 --> 40:48.291
<i>Aren't we capable of facing</i>
them on our own?

40:50.541 --> 40:55.500
<i>Thinna, it’s just as wrong to overestimate</i>
one’s enemy out of fear...

40:55.791 --> 40:59.583
<i>as it is to underestimate them</i>
by denying how dangerous they are.

40:59.875 --> 41:03.000
<i>You really believe the other clans will set aside</i>
their long time grudges and stand with us?

41:03.666 --> 41:07.625
<i>A new enemy is far more</i>
dangerous than an old feud...

41:08.041 --> 41:13.958
<i>They’ll come together to fight</i>
but not to fight as one.

41:14.375 --> 41:15.583
I have grave doubts, Father.

41:15.791 --> 41:17.333
I already sent word to get it going.

41:18.458 --> 41:19.583
Everyone is committed.

41:20.500 --> 41:25.250
<i>As a Father and the Village leader,</i>
my order stands.

41:27.416 --> 41:28.541
What can I say now?

41:33.916 --> 41:38.416
<i>We welcome Chanda,</i>
their leader of Bhalluka's and his people.

41:45.041 --> 41:48.708
<i>Hereditary worshippers</i>
and the guardians of Vayulinga,

41:48.916 --> 41:51.791
we welcome the leader Kampa and his army.

41:58.625 --> 42:04.041
<i>We welcome the leader Mundadu,</i>
his son Bebbuli and whole clan.

42:10.250 --> 42:15.208
<i>We welcome the clan queen Pannaga,</i>
princess Nemali and the whole clan of women

42:19.208 --> 42:23.958
<i>The leader Nadhanadha and his son...</i>
Welcome to Thinnadu!

42:49.250 --> 42:54.583
<i>Nathanatha,</i>
Kalamukha is invading your village.

42:54.791 --> 42:57.958
<i>Why should we help?</i>
Why did you send for us?

42:58.125 --> 43:01.708
<i>He is not my enemy alone,</i>
he is all our foe.

43:01.833 --> 43:02.666
Oh!

43:02.833 --> 43:05.916
<i>If he launches an attack,</i>
he will lay waste to the five hamlets.

43:06.125 --> 43:12.666
<i>He wants the Vayulingam.</i>
Bhadragana is its protector.

43:13.083 --> 43:14.291
<i>Why should we get involved</i>
in that conflict?

43:14.333 --> 43:16.041
We are self-reliant.

43:16.208 --> 43:19.500
We can safeguard the Vayulingam on our own.

43:20.250 --> 43:23.541
<i>We aren’t as feeble as bangled</i>
folks in Pannaga's village.

43:23.750 --> 43:25.291
Keep quiet, Gavvaraju.

43:25.458 --> 43:29.583
<i>For thousands of years, women</i>
have been leaders in our village.

43:29.916 --> 43:36.166
<i>Our Nemali is more than capable of dealing</i>
with any challenges posed by the enemy.

43:37.208 --> 43:39.000
Pannaga is talks too much.

43:39.583 --> 43:41.000
Settle down.

43:41.750 --> 43:44.958
Anyone daring to speak ill of Pannaga,

43:45.375 --> 43:48.791
<i>be warned, my mace</i>
can dispense grievous consequences.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.541
<i>What non-sense.</i>
We shall see about that.

43:51.875 --> 43:53.583
<i>- Hey!</i>
- Hey, come!

43:53.750 --> 43:54.625
Wait!

43:55.625 --> 43:57.083
<i>- Hey, come!</i>
- Will all of you please calm down?

43:57.208 --> 43:58.666
We share a lineage.

43:59.125 --> 44:03.208
<i>Our ancestors divided this forest</i>
into five parts and left them it to us.

44:03.291 --> 44:04.125
Why?

44:04.833 --> 44:07.541
<i>For our collective contentment</i>
within our respective domains.

44:08.083 --> 44:11.833
<i>Yet, here we are, embroiled in</i>
needless conflicts.

44:12.041 --> 44:15.041
<i>Let’s put aside these grievances and</i>
unite against our common foe.

44:15.125 --> 44:17.291
I raise my hands and bow in humility.

44:18.666 --> 44:22.166
Father, I don’t like you bowing.

44:22.375 --> 44:25.208
<i>Why should I be ashamed to</i>
humble my head to protect...

44:26.250 --> 44:28.416
the heads of our villagers.

44:28.791 --> 44:33.000
<i>Father, I am willing to bow my head</i>
or even cut it off for your sake.

44:33.416 --> 44:36.250
<i>If Mother is in danger will the children</i>
fight amongst themselves or save it?

44:36.416 --> 44:40.625
<i>This forest is our mother too.</i>
We all must unite to face Kalamukha...

44:41.666 --> 44:42.833
Well said, Thinnadu.

44:43.166 --> 44:48.666
<i>Thinna! Let us stand together, young</i>
and old, and confront this.

44:48.916 --> 44:51.666
<i>We’ll carry on henceforth under</i>
Thinnadu’s leadership.

44:53.583 --> 44:54.958
Bebbuli is our leader.

44:55.041 --> 44:57.666
<i>Three people are needed to lift</i>
Bebbuli's mace.

44:57.750 --> 45:00.500
We need such a strong leader.

45:01.416 --> 45:03.083
<i>- Shamba...</i>
- Bebbuli...

45:09.375 --> 45:12.166
<i>All those who want Bebbuli for leader</i>
indicate support by raising your hands.

45:13.291 --> 45:20.416
Bebbuli.. Bebbuli.. Bebbuli...

45:21.833 --> 45:24.958
<i>And those who want Thinnadu</i>
for leader, raise your hands.

45:25.166 --> 45:27.958
<i>Thinna!</i>
Thinnadu... Thinnadu...

45:28.083 --> 45:34.208
Thinnadu... Thinnadu... Thinnadu...

45:34.291 --> 45:39.041
Thinnadu... Thinnadu...

45:39.541 --> 45:46.915
<i>Out of five Clans, three want Thinnadu.</i>
Thinnadu is our leader.

45:46.916 --> 45:53.250
Thinnadu... Thinnadu... Thinnadu...

45:54.458 --> 45:56.166
He is the leader.

45:56.666 --> 45:57.541
Father,

45:58.833 --> 46:03.041
he needs to be alive to be a leader.

46:03.208 --> 46:04.500
Ha ha ha ...

46:04.791 --> 46:08.083
Brother, Tenkhana!

46:20.083 --> 46:20.791
Hey!

46:21.375 --> 46:26.166
<i>You come here with that message</i>
without killing the killer of my brother?

46:32.083 --> 46:33.916
Kalamukhaa!

46:35.416 --> 46:41.250
<i>It happened as I expected.</i>
From a long time now,

46:41.541 --> 46:48.583
<i>The warriors, the brave, the hunters,</i>
the archers, are protecting the area of pottapinadu.

46:50.500 --> 46:51.541
Bappaswamy,

46:53.750 --> 46:56.458
you said Vayulingam can revive the dead.

46:57.625 --> 47:02.208
<i>You said entire sand turns gold,</i>
just by the breeze from it.

47:04.541 --> 47:07.708
<i>The murderer of my brother</i>
who came to capture the Vayulingam...

47:09.125 --> 47:10.833
I will not spare Thinnadu,

47:12.875 --> 47:21.375
<i>I will destroy Thinnadu's village,</i>
his forest, and him,

47:24.458 --> 47:27.125
and get my Vayulingam.

47:32.166 --> 47:37.666
<i>Blessed Shiva, I brought you cashew</i>
fruits, guavas, jackfruits and honey.

47:37.875 --> 47:39.416
<i>I hope you enjoy them to your</i>
heart's content, Swami.

47:41.833 --> 47:42.791
Yo, Shishya...

47:42.833 --> 47:43.625
Learned sir?

47:43.708 --> 47:46.333
What do you make of this girl’s devotion?

47:46.416 --> 47:51.083
<i>I feel, Guruji, if we don’t show</i>
her the Vayulingam,

47:51.250 --> 47:53.415
someone else will come along and do it.

47:53.416 --> 47:55.916
Yes, yes, me too.

47:56.125 --> 47:59.291
<i>Before he gets here,</i>
handle my body for once...

47:59.458 --> 48:00.875
Shiva Shiva. Shiva Shiva.

48:01.083 --> 48:05.458
Om Namah Shivaya...

48:06.541 --> 48:10.000
Om Namah Shivaya...

48:12.458 --> 48:20.083
Om Namah Shivaya...

48:20.416 --> 48:23.500
Ow! That hit me in a bad place.

48:27.250 --> 48:29.708
Om Namah Shivaya...

48:30.083 --> 48:35.541
<i>What is he doing?</i>
He’s eating all the fruit.

48:35.750 --> 48:36.875
What he does is none of our concern, Guruji.

48:36.916 --> 48:39.333
<i>His hand is almost as big as</i>
your thigh. Let him be.

48:39.375 --> 48:40.250
Yes it is...

48:40.583 --> 48:43.500
Om Namah Shivayya...

48:52.875 --> 48:56.666
<i>Look, masters!</i>
Shiva has eaten all the fruit I offered.

48:56.875 --> 48:58.666
Ah, Shivayya ate all your fruits.

48:58.791 --> 49:01.041
Shivayya... Shivayya...

49:01.500 --> 49:03.416
There’s Shivayya now.

49:09.208 --> 49:11.333
Hey you!

49:12.458 --> 49:14.666
<i>You should be ashamed,</i>
eating the fruits I offered to God.

49:15.708 --> 49:16.500
I'm coming.

49:20.375 --> 49:23.208
Are you crazy? Rocks don’t eat fruits.

49:26.791 --> 49:28.208
Don’t call Shiva a rock!

49:29.791 --> 49:32.333
<i>What else should I call a rock</i>
but a rock, Queen Nemali?

51:20.625 --> 51:22.333
Shall I push my sword into your heart?

51:22.791 --> 51:24.583
My heart is filled with you.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.500
There’s no room left for your sword.

51:27.708 --> 51:31.500
<i>A banyan tree-sized man, brought</i>
down by the strength of a girl.

51:31.833 --> 51:33.875
I had the strength to overpower an elephant,

51:34.708 --> 51:37.041
<i>but it evaporated</i>
when I gazed into your eyes.

51:37.250 --> 51:40.583
If you have so much strength, win the war.

51:41.375 --> 51:42.208
Not me.

51:48.875 --> 51:52.000
I’ll win both the war and you.

51:52.625 --> 51:55.833
It’s my vow. Thinnadu’s vow.

52:05.125 --> 52:09.875
<i>Nathanatha, here is the engagement proposal</i>
of my daughter Sivangi with your son Thinnadu.

52:12.583 --> 52:16.708
<i>Thinnadu doesn't believe in Devi or</i>
the words you she speaks through you.

52:17.166 --> 52:18.500
<i>How can you make an alliance</i>
with him?

52:21.875 --> 52:24.625
<i>Thinnadu has now become</i>
the leader of the five kingdoms.

52:25.250 --> 52:30.916
<i>Tomorrow, he will be crowned king,</i>
and my daughter will be Queen.

52:31.625 --> 52:32.958
After their union is consecrated,

52:33.000 --> 52:37.833
<i>Thinnadu will be bound by his oath to Shivangi</i>
and will be unable to act against me.

52:42.875 --> 52:45.166
Nemali, why are you so shy within?

52:45.750 --> 52:48.625
<i>You fought with Thinnadu</i>
and now are you in love?

52:50.625 --> 52:51.958
Thinnadu has a good heart.

52:52.791 --> 52:54.291
What's wrong if I fall in love?

52:55.833 --> 52:57.916
He loves his hamlet so much.

52:59.041 --> 53:02.541
Won't he take at most care of his wife?

53:03.916 --> 53:08.208
<i>Courage, dare, loyalty, morality!</i>
He's all in one.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.041
<i>He knows it all.</i>
That is my Thinna.

53:11.291 --> 53:12.125
Oh, is it?

53:12.375 --> 53:13.916
Wow, nice cluster of palm fruits.

53:19.083 --> 53:21.208
Wow, cluster full of fruits.

53:33.083 --> 53:34.041
What’s so funny?

53:34.208 --> 53:36.208
Never seen anyone try to do that before.

53:36.791 --> 53:38.625
<i>- Let's go.</i>
- Show me then.

53:38.666 --> 53:40.124
Why us here as a disturbance?

53:40.125 --> 53:44.458
<i>No, you are the future queen,</i>
I will guide you to hit it.

53:47.500 --> 53:49.125
Hold this.

54:14.500 --> 54:15.958
Can you see the fruits?

54:17.208 --> 54:18.791
I can see the whole bunch.

54:19.875 --> 54:21.541
Focus on the one fruit you like best.

54:26.375 --> 54:27.125
There...

54:32.125 --> 54:33.000
I did.

54:33.625 --> 54:35.708
Aim the arrow where your mind is.

54:37.458 --> 54:38.458
I did!

54:38.666 --> 54:39.791
Hold your breath.

54:40.291 --> 54:41.208
I did.

54:46.250 --> 54:47.041
Shoot!

54:58.166 --> 54:59.666
How skilled you are.

55:00.166 --> 55:03.416
But you knocked down the whole bunch!

55:04.208 --> 55:05.458
The Ice water Apple.

55:11.833 --> 55:12.625
Gah!

55:14.750 --> 55:17.125
It’s okay, leave it alone...

55:17.333 --> 55:19.583
Aha! Such a strong leader,

55:19.958 --> 55:22.458
<i>but a drop of water falls and</i>
you act like your eye fell out!

55:24.916 --> 55:28.041
<i>My Father told me</i>
I have my mother’s eyes.

55:29.708 --> 55:31.500
I beheld my mother through them.

55:32.833 --> 55:33.958
Then I saw you.

55:35.875 --> 55:38.458
<i>I want to see you</i>
with them for the rest of my life.

56:26.416 --> 56:27.999
“Promise upon Mother Jungle's flowers”

56:28.000 --> 56:29.541
“Promise upon Rain's moist kisses”

56:29.666 --> 56:31.083
“Promise upon the Morning Sun”

56:31.291 --> 56:34.166
<i>“Shall I approach, becoming</i>
the step beneath your feet?”

56:34.708 --> 56:36.415
<i>“Promise upon the delicate</i>
eyelids of your eyes”

56:36.416 --> 56:38.165
<i>“Promise upon the braids</i>
that formed your hair bun”

56:38.166 --> 56:39.832
<i>“Promise upon your eyes</i>
that gazed upon me”

56:39.833 --> 56:42.875
<i>“Shall I transform into</i>
the rhythm of your heart?”

56:52.958 --> 56:59.458
<i>“In the sky street,</i>
there is a beautiful Moon”

56:59.791 --> 57:05.750
<i>“With its sweeping beauty,</i>
playing romantic games”

57:05.958 --> 57:09.166
<i>“In the cheeks of marigold,</i>
in the sound of kisses”

57:09.333 --> 57:12.583
“Are you listening to my words?”

57:12.750 --> 57:16.083
“Upon hearing new sounds in the hugs”

57:16.291 --> 57:19.166
“It feels new, this time”

57:19.375 --> 57:22.583
<i>“Greetings to the ones</i>
who gave birth to you”

57:22.791 --> 57:26.208
<i>“How did they give birth</i>
to you like this?”

57:26.583 --> 57:29.291
“May some star steal your eye”

57:29.500 --> 57:33.000
<i>“What can one do if it comes</i>
down like a needle like this?”

58:12.083 --> 58:15.291
“Are you listening?”

58:15.500 --> 58:18.625
“Oh sounds in the river of lips”

58:18.791 --> 58:25.458
<i>“That’s why I am hurrying</i>
like a boat”

58:25.625 --> 58:28.916
<i>“Don’t leave me, even in</i>
your dreams”

58:29.125 --> 58:32.250
“Don’t let chaos wedge between us”

58:32.458 --> 58:35.750
<i>“I will look after you than</i>
I do for my own breath”

58:35.958 --> 58:39.166
<i>“I will cherish you as if</i>
you were my own life”

58:39.375 --> 58:42.791
<i>“Pausing along our journey,</i>
pausing and laughing”

58:43.000 --> 58:45.958
“There’s a great disturbance within me”

58:46.166 --> 58:49.583
<i>“Adding each other’s names,</i>
erasing the distance”

58:49.791 --> 58:52.708
<i>“In the manner that feels</i>
like going crazy”

58:52.875 --> 58:56.083
<i>“Greetings to the ones</i>
who gave birth to you”

58:56.291 --> 58:59.708
<i>“How did they bring you</i>
into this world?”

59:00.125 --> 59:02.833
<i>“May some star steal</i>
the twinkle from your eye”

59:03.208 --> 59:05.250
<i>“What can be done if it falls</i>
like a needle like in this way?”

59:09.083 --> 59:12.083
<i>For how many more years are</i>
we going to steal kisses?

59:12.375 --> 59:13.750
Can’t we expedite our marriage?

59:13.791 --> 59:16.375
<i>We will. We will.</i>
After the New Moon.

59:38.291 --> 59:40.291
<i>- Thinna, move.</i>
- Hmm.

59:40.666 --> 59:41.290
Why?

59:41.291 --> 59:42.875
<i>- Just a bit.</i>
- Why?

59:46.083 --> 59:47.833
Your breath touches me with a warmth.

59:48.833 --> 59:49.875
Let it be.

59:51.541 --> 59:52.541
The feeling is...

59:54.541 --> 59:55.916
something... unexplainable.

01:00:04.083 --> 01:00:04.958
Let it be.

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:20.208
<i>An intoxicating, ticklish</i>
feeling inside... all new...

01:00:21.166 --> 01:00:22.208
Intoxicating...

01:00:24.125 --> 01:00:24.958
Let it be...

01:00:26.958 --> 01:00:29.625
Do you really want me to move?

01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:39.041
Thinnaa...

01:00:41.625 --> 01:00:42.458
Thinnaa...

01:00:43.625 --> 01:00:44.291
What?

01:00:50.125 --> 01:00:52.916
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

01:00:53.416 --> 01:00:55.875
Shambha...

01:00:56.916 --> 01:00:59.833
<i>- Shambha...</i>
- Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:04.625
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

01:01:06.875 --> 01:01:11.833
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

01:01:12.541 --> 01:01:15.208
<i>- Shambha...</i>
- Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

01:01:15.625 --> 01:01:17.958
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

01:01:18.083 --> 01:01:19.583
Shambha...

01:01:19.791 --> 01:01:25.958
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:29.625
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

01:01:31.125 --> 01:01:34.500
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:42.541
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

01:01:43.708 --> 01:01:50.666
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:52.041
Mali...

01:01:57.625 --> 01:01:58.500
Mali...

01:02:07.458 --> 01:02:13.500
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:51.458
<i>- What is he doing?</i>
- I don't understand the same.

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:54.041
Thinna, what are you doing?

01:02:55.583 --> 01:02:57.625
<i>I’m asking the same, Father.</i>
What is this?

01:02:58.291 --> 01:03:01.708
<i>Spilling blood in front of this rock</i>
gives no one any power.

01:03:02.333 --> 01:03:04.125
No more human sacrifice!

01:03:05.625 --> 01:03:08.041
Thinnaa, I'm ready for the sacrifice.

01:03:08.333 --> 01:03:09.166
You fool.

01:03:09.958 --> 01:03:14.125
<i>You should be on your way</i>
to kill thousands of enemies in war.

01:03:14.375 --> 01:03:15.166
Thinna!

01:03:16.166 --> 01:03:20.541
<i>This is a long time tradition here.</i>
It is to insult Goddess if that's stopped.

01:03:20.708 --> 01:03:24.916
<i>What kind of stone god craves hero’s heads</i>
when they’re needed in wartime?

01:03:25.125 --> 01:03:28.416
<i>Let’s respect our benevolent mother,</i>
sisters, and daughters.

01:03:28.625 --> 01:03:31.083
Forsake this rock that thirsts for blood.

01:03:31.833 --> 01:03:34.750
<i>Human sacrifices will not take place</i>
as long as I live in this hamlet.

01:03:35.916 --> 01:03:36.875
I will not permit it.

01:03:38.208 --> 01:03:40.375
This is my vow... Thinna’s vow.

01:03:42.083 --> 01:03:45.166
<i>If you save Mali’s life,</i>
we all will lose ours.

01:03:45.375 --> 01:03:46.916
Mother will narrow her red eye.

01:03:47.125 --> 01:03:47.916
Mother...?

01:03:48.625 --> 01:03:51.416
<i>Mother to who?</i>
To whom did she give birth in this hamlet?

01:03:51.625 --> 01:03:52.583
Whom did she raise?

01:03:53.375 --> 01:03:57.250
<i>'Mother' signifies nurturing,</i>
caressing, caring...

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.666
<i>A creature that consumes others</i>
is a wild beast.

01:04:01.416 --> 01:04:04.291
<i>How can we call this a mother</i>
when she devours our fellow humans?

01:04:05.791 --> 01:04:11.291
<i>A god should protect our hamlet</i>
by consuming our enemies...

01:04:12.166 --> 01:04:19.750
<i>If warrirors are sacrificed when danger arises, humans</i>
will not be left in this hamlet except the huts, father.

01:04:20.791 --> 01:04:26.125
<i>Is this stone bargaining to give a hundred lives</i>
by taking one life, a Goddess?

01:04:32.208 --> 01:04:35.833
Who are you to question tradition?

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.708
<i>What kind of leader defies</i>
the forest tradition?

01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:39.582
YES!

01:04:39.583 --> 01:04:41.333
<i>Whatever Maremma declares</i>
is Ammori's word.

01:04:41.416 --> 01:04:43.750
<i>- How dare you question Ammoru’s word?</i>
- I defy.

01:04:44.708 --> 01:04:48.165
<i>I question. This is a plot to eliminate Mali,</i>
who loves Shivangi.

01:04:48.166 --> 01:04:48.832
That's a lie.

01:04:48.833 --> 01:04:49.791
You know it’s true.

01:04:50.583 --> 01:04:51.333
Hey!

01:04:52.208 --> 01:04:54.375
You want us to pay attention to this?

01:04:55.916 --> 01:04:59.458
<i>Nathanatha, your son holds no affection</i>
for our deities or fondness for sacrifices.

01:05:00.125 --> 01:05:01.250
<i>He lacks</i>
faith in ritual observance.

01:05:01.333 --> 01:05:02.375
Why put my faith in them?

01:05:03.458 --> 01:05:05.500
Why bathe idols that don't sweat?

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.291
Why marry stones that lie inanimate?

01:05:11.125 --> 01:05:15.708
<i>Why houses for rocks</i>
that can’t feel warmth or cold?

01:05:17.208 --> 01:05:20.583
<i>Why appeal to those without ears?</i>
Why prostrate before them?

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.250
We must bow down to them? Huh?

01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:32.916
Oh, you are pointing faults in Gods.

01:05:33.125 --> 01:05:37.583
<i>You’ve been fraternizing with Nemali,</i>
who is pledged to marry me.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.500
Is that not inappropriate?

01:05:40.333 --> 01:05:41.958
I’m not going to marrying you!

01:05:42.458 --> 01:05:43.666
Ask your mother.

01:05:44.416 --> 01:05:46.750
Yes! We made a commitment.

01:05:47.083 --> 01:05:50.208
<i>- We have every right to arrange your matrimony.</i>
- No.

01:05:51.041 --> 01:05:53.124
Without learning their daughter’s feelings,

01:05:53.125 --> 01:05:55.125
<i>no parent has the right</i>
to orchestrate a marriage.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.500
I have pledged my heart to Thinnadu.

01:05:59.916 --> 01:06:01.125
My union is with him and only him.

01:06:01.208 --> 01:06:05.458
<i>I assert my claim.</i>
And who dares to stop me?

01:06:05.583 --> 01:06:06.375
Just a minute.

01:06:07.125 --> 01:06:09.166
You lay one hand on Nemali, you lose it.

01:06:09.375 --> 01:06:10.250
Thinna...

01:06:10.666 --> 01:06:12.416
There’s a tradition in this woodland.

01:06:12.625 --> 01:06:15.708
<i>If two men have a dispute over a woman,</i>
they must engage in a contest.

01:06:15.916 --> 01:06:18.833
The winner gets the lady’s hand.

01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:23.583
<i>The competitors may use</i>
their preferred weapons.

01:06:23.875 --> 01:06:28.291
I don’t need any weapons to defeat him.

01:06:30.083 --> 01:06:32.916
My two strong hands are enough.

01:06:41.125 --> 01:06:47.166
<i>Let's see if your hands work</i>
as much as your mouth.

01:06:54.083 --> 01:07:00.125
Bebbuli... Bebbuli... Bebbuli...

01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:20.041
Bebbuli... Bebbuli... Bebbuli...

01:07:20.875 --> 01:07:26.833
Thinnadu... Thinnadu... Thinnadu...

01:07:30.708 --> 01:07:34.500
Thinnadu... Thinnadu... Thinnadu...

01:07:35.458 --> 01:07:40.708
Bebbuli... Bebbuli... Bebbuli...

01:08:40.833 --> 01:08:44.625
Thinnadu... Thinnadu... Thinnadu...

01:09:01.750 --> 01:09:06.750
Bebbuli... Bebbuli... Bebbuli...

01:09:09.791 --> 01:09:13.833
Hey Thinnadu, I’ll kill you.

01:09:14.833 --> 01:09:18.750
<i>I’ll marry Nemali,</i>
have some fun with her, then leave her.

01:09:19.375 --> 01:09:24.666
<i>And I assure you, every man in my village</i>
will do the same with her.

01:09:30.791 --> 01:09:36.583
Thinnadu... Thinnadu... Thinnadu...

01:09:36.875 --> 01:09:43.875
Thinnadu... Thinnadu... Thinnadu...

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.625
Thinnadu... Thinnadu... Thinnadu...

01:09:55.291 --> 01:10:00.833
Thinnadu... Thinnadu... Thinnadu...

01:10:03.958 --> 01:10:09.791
Thinnadu... Thinnadu... Thinnadu...

01:10:18.041 --> 01:10:25.500
Thinnadu... Thinnadu... Thinnadu...

01:10:32.291 --> 01:10:39.541
Thinnadu... Thinnadu... Thinnadu...

01:10:50.458 --> 01:10:52.291
You want to fight more?

01:10:53.083 --> 01:10:57.083
<i>First hit your father and kill him and then</i>
kill all of your village and your tribe.

01:10:57.416 --> 01:10:58.124
Father...

01:10:58.125 --> 01:11:02.208
<i>You’re turning every clan member into</i>
an enemy, when we are making friends...

01:11:02.291 --> 01:11:03.625
Hey Bebbuli, get up man.

01:11:03.875 --> 01:11:07.541
<i>Are you the leader of your clan or</i>
a monster who possesses people?

01:11:08.166 --> 01:11:10.875
<i>You call for us to unite</i>
but you end my son’s life?

01:11:11.625 --> 01:11:13.499
We will not be united with such a guy.

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:16.291
<i>Nathanatha,</i>
we will not tolerate an insult to Ammoru.

01:11:16.416 --> 01:11:17.708
This is unforgivable.

01:11:17.916 --> 01:11:18.791
Come, let's leave.

01:11:21.458 --> 01:11:23.083
Wait! Wait!

01:11:24.458 --> 01:11:25.458
Please, wait.

01:11:27.458 --> 01:11:31.916
<i>For those who defy the goddess,</i>
who strays from our ways,

01:11:32.458 --> 01:11:37.208
<i>who ignore the wisdom of our elders,</i>
there is no place in this village.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:47.458
<i>I right away expel Thinnadu, who sowed</i>
discord during the union of our five clans.

01:11:48.333 --> 01:11:49.000
Father!

01:11:50.833 --> 01:11:52.708
You can’t mean it, Father!

01:11:53.458 --> 01:11:55.625
You saw what happened with your own eyes.

01:11:56.166 --> 01:11:58.666
Why point your accusatory finger at me?

01:11:59.083 --> 01:12:00.583
My decision is final.

01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:04.750
You have no place in this Village. Leave.

01:12:05.291 --> 01:12:06.125
Father...

01:12:06.375 --> 01:12:08.958
<i>Until now you’ve cried at your</i>
mother's graveside.

01:12:09.583 --> 01:12:11.833
<i>If you refuse to go, from tomorrow</i>
onwards you’ll be crying at mine.

01:12:12.541 --> 01:12:17.416
<i>My Lord. Please don’t be hasty.</i>
It seems like Thinnadu is not at fault here.

01:12:17.875 --> 01:12:18.708
Father in law...

01:12:19.583 --> 01:12:21.000
Father, you're in anger.

01:12:22.916 --> 01:12:25.125
<i>It’s not a mistake, if committed</i>
when you’re angry.

01:12:26.708 --> 01:12:31.541
<i>But your heart knows</i>
what’s right and wrong.

01:12:44.041 --> 01:12:44.708
Stop...

01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:45.916
Mother, let me go.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.875
<i>I love Thinna.</i>
I’ll only marry Thinna.

01:12:51.208 --> 01:12:55.625
<i>If you talk of him or even think about him</i>
I will not spare you.

01:12:57.083 --> 01:12:59.666
I’ll kill you. Come.

01:13:06.333 --> 01:13:07.083
Thinna.

01:13:51.166 --> 01:13:51.875
Thinna.

01:14:19.541 --> 01:14:21.416
<i>He then expressed his disbelief</i>
in the existence of God,

01:14:21.916 --> 01:14:24.333
<i>and now he’s separated himself</i>
from all relatives and friends.

01:14:24.958 --> 01:14:30.125
<i>So, explain your belief that such a person</i>
will be your great devotee, Divine Lord?

01:14:31.625 --> 01:14:35.000
Everything is done for a reason.

01:14:35.541 --> 01:14:39.583
His devotion is why he took this incarnation.

01:14:39.958 --> 01:14:45.500
<i>His search for truth, strength of will,</i>
unparalleled archery skills,

01:14:45.708 --> 01:14:50.958
should remind you who he is, Devi.

01:14:51.375 --> 01:14:55.541
<i>See with the eyes of knowledge,</i>
O Divine Queen of the Court in Kalahasthi,

01:14:56.333 --> 01:15:04.041
<i>and you’ll know who has sailed the river</i>
of eternity to come to Earth as Thinnadu.

01:15:06.583 --> 01:15:09.083
Om Namah Sivaya!

01:15:09.958 --> 01:15:12.375
Om Namah Sivaya!

01:15:13.208 --> 01:15:15.791
Om Namah Sivaya!

01:15:16.875 --> 01:15:19.375
Om Namah Sivaya!

01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:23.416
Om Namah Sivaya!

01:15:24.458 --> 01:15:27.041
Om Namah Sivaya!

01:15:27.791 --> 01:15:30.333
Om Namah Sivaya!

01:15:30.958 --> 01:15:33.541
Om Namah Sivaya!

01:15:34.041 --> 01:15:37.500
Om Namah Sivaya!

01:16:11.250 --> 01:16:11.916
Hey!

01:17:14.458 --> 01:17:17.916
<i>Kirata... My spiritual heat has grown tainted</i>
from living as this Varaha creature,

01:17:18.291 --> 01:17:20.958
<i>so I have shed its form.</i>
Take its body away.

01:17:21.333 --> 01:17:23.458
Heck, Kid.

01:17:24.833 --> 01:17:27.166
You're doing me a favour?

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.083
<i>The kill is mine.</i>
The territory is mine.

01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:33.791
So this Varaha is mine. Get lost!

01:17:33.958 --> 01:17:35.041
That arrogance won't do.

01:17:35.416 --> 01:17:38.291
<i>You know this is Arjuna, son of</i>
Kunti, you're mouthing off to?

01:17:38.416 --> 01:17:41.000
Oh... You're Arjuna!

01:17:41.666 --> 01:17:42.916
I've heard of you.

01:17:43.666 --> 01:17:46.625
<i>You found out someone was</i>
a better archer than you.

01:17:46.875 --> 01:17:50.250
<i>You couldn’t handle it,</i>
so you had his thumb cut off, huh?

01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:53.333
Get lost. Get out of here.

01:17:53.708 --> 01:17:58.833
<i>So, Kirata, it’s not enough to mock just me,</i>
you mock my archery ability, too?

01:17:59.583 --> 01:18:02.166
I can prove my skill with just one arrow.

01:18:03.875 --> 01:18:05.208
Well, aren't you the talented one.

01:18:08.625 --> 01:18:13.541
<i>Can you hit that hole in the tree</i>
over there faster than me?

01:18:59.958 --> 01:19:07.583
<i>See if your luck is better with</i>
the sword than with the bow.

01:20:41.375 --> 01:20:44.333
A tribal man competing with this Kireeti?

01:20:45.166 --> 01:20:45.958
That's impossible.

01:20:46.791 --> 01:20:47.666
Who is he?

01:21:18.458 --> 01:21:21.500
“Who is he, who is this tribal man?”

01:21:21.708 --> 01:21:24.875
<i>“He is three eyed Lord</i>
ruling the three worlds”

01:21:25.041 --> 01:21:28.166
<i>“Who is he, who is this</i>
tribal man?”

01:21:28.375 --> 01:21:31.625
<i>“He is three eyed Lord ruling</i>
the three worlds”

01:21:31.833 --> 01:21:35.041
<i>“He is not Keechaka</i>
putting down Arjuna”

01:21:35.250 --> 01:21:38.416
<i>“He is Lord Shiva blessing</i>
with strength to the needy”

01:21:38.625 --> 01:21:41.750
“He is Lord Shiva in disguise”

01:21:41.958 --> 01:21:45.166
<i>“He is Shiva looking like</i>
a monster”

01:21:45.375 --> 01:21:46.666
“He is Lord Shiva”

01:21:46.875 --> 01:21:49.250
“He is Lord Shiva”

01:21:55.833 --> 01:21:59.125
<i>Ego makes even the finest</i>
weapon worthless, Kid.

01:22:00.125 --> 01:22:03.333
<i>Admit defeat now and you might</i>
get another chance to win.

01:22:13.666 --> 01:22:15.791
Lord of Lords. Almighty.

01:22:16.625 --> 01:22:18.958
Shiva Shankaraa. Gracious One...

01:22:26.541 --> 01:22:28.041
He with the mountain of matted hair.

01:22:30.083 --> 01:22:37.458
<i>Who can triumph</i>
if Lord Shiva is their opponent?

01:22:39.125 --> 01:22:45.833
<i>That I boasted of skill in Archery,</i>
but mine is nothing next to your power.

01:22:47.666 --> 01:22:51.458
<i>Why test me?</i>
I am your penitent, my Lord.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:58.791
<i>I thought giving the most powerful</i>
Pasupatastra without testing...

01:22:58.958 --> 01:23:01.875
your power would be inappropriate.

01:23:03.041 --> 01:23:05.875
Lord. Shining Solitude.

01:23:06.458 --> 01:23:07.666
Lord of Mercy.

01:23:09.208 --> 01:23:14.916
<i>All my worldly emotions melted</i>
out with your holy appearance.

01:23:16.208 --> 01:23:22.000
<i>I have no desire to use these weapons,</i>
but neither do I desire

01:23:23.250 --> 01:23:27.500
to win the pleasures of heaven.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:34.833
<i>Shower your mercy and blessings</i>
and let me serve your holy feet.

01:23:36.208 --> 01:23:38.916
Grant me salvation, Lord of All.

01:23:41.416 --> 01:23:43.125
Not in this life, Arjuna.

01:23:44.833 --> 01:23:49.791
<i>You have a key role in the righteous</i>
war that will soon take place.

01:23:50.958 --> 01:23:56.000
I have much for you to do in this life.

01:23:58.666 --> 01:24:01.875
<i>If you pursue the righteous path</i>
in the next birth,

01:24:02.458 --> 01:24:04.208
you will obtain the salvation you seek.

01:24:05.125 --> 01:24:06.875
Another life?

01:24:08.708 --> 01:24:12.458
<i>My reward for my years of penance</i>
is only to wield Pashupatastra,

01:24:13.833 --> 01:24:18.166
<i>I desire unity in death with Shiva.</i>
How many Great Ages must I do penance, Swami?

01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:19.750
Mighty Warrior,

01:24:20.333 --> 01:24:29.000
<i>call my name but once with true faith</i>
in your next life as Thinnadu,

01:24:29.875 --> 01:24:31.958
and I will merge you into me.

01:24:40.250 --> 01:24:43.166
Om Namahsivaya!

01:25:03.083 --> 01:25:04.750
Thinna is Arjuna?

01:25:06.166 --> 01:25:12.833
<i>Arjuna failed to save 16 thousand</i>
gopis after Krishna left his incarnation

01:25:12.875 --> 01:25:16.500
<i>in the Third Great Age and lost</i>
in the hands of boyas.

01:25:23.250 --> 01:25:28.916
<i>He is reborn this time as a result of constant</i>
obsession with his past failure.

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:31.875
Karma rules everyone.

01:25:34.458 --> 01:25:38.125
<i>And when will Thinnadu be</i>
free from that karmic bond?

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:43.708
<i>You and I are both eagerly</i>
wondering when that will happen.

01:25:50.833 --> 01:25:51.875
Queen Pannaga...

01:25:53.291 --> 01:25:58.500
<i>You invited us here to teach Nemali.</i>
Nemali doesn’t need us anymore.

01:25:58.958 --> 01:26:03.416
Nemali, you learbt a great lesson in life.

01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:07.625
<i>You have the courage to oppose</i>
anyone for your love.

01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:09.333
Mr. Pinch!

01:26:10.666 --> 01:26:14.541
<i>Queen Pannaga,</i>
no problem if you mistook my name.

01:26:15.291 --> 01:26:18.208
<i>But do not take a wrong decision</i>
in regards with your daughter.

01:26:21.708 --> 01:26:22.625
Nemali,

01:26:24.416 --> 01:26:31.250
<i>you take one step out my sight,</i>
you divide us forever.

01:26:32.583 --> 01:26:38.166
<i>I’ll take that step</i>
and seven more with Thinnadu.

01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:04.166
You’re upset your father sent away.

01:27:05.375 --> 01:27:06.416
No, not at all.

01:27:07.875 --> 01:27:10.500
<i>If my father said, ‘Throw yourself</i>
into that fire,’ I would obey him.

01:27:13.291 --> 01:27:15.041
I'm not worried about myself.

01:27:17.166 --> 01:27:19.666
What's to become of my father?

01:27:22.833 --> 01:27:26.791
Everyone has to reckon with loneliness.

01:27:29.416 --> 01:27:30.875
It’ll be tough.

01:27:32.541 --> 01:27:34.291
But facing it we learn what people,

01:27:35.208 --> 01:27:41.416
<i>our relationships,</i>
and life itself really mean to us.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.333
I am away from my father and village.

01:27:55.250 --> 01:27:57.666
Why did you come to me, Nemali?

01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:01.500
You are my family.

01:28:05.666 --> 01:28:06.791
This is my village.

01:28:08.333 --> 01:28:10.250
You are my strength and honour.

01:28:11.625 --> 01:28:13.250
I have it all here with you.

01:28:17.916 --> 01:28:19.041
And where will you live?

01:28:23.083 --> 01:28:27.666
<i>Didn't your father teach you</i>
how to build a hut?

01:28:28.916 --> 01:28:29.916
What will you eat?

01:28:31.125 --> 01:28:32.666
You know how to hunt, right?

01:28:33.791 --> 01:28:35.083
Who will you confide in?

01:28:37.208 --> 01:28:43.000
I don’t confide and waste time.

01:28:43.916 --> 01:28:45.250
<i>Then how about we get</i>
married, Nemali?

01:28:47.875 --> 01:28:49.625
Sure. Is there a temple around here?

01:28:54.583 --> 01:28:58.875
<i>My mother's resting place is the greatest</i>
temple I know of in the whole world.

01:29:06.541 --> 01:29:12.375
<i>Mother, bless us, even though Father's</i>
not here to we're see us married.

01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:19.791
I now place my life in your hands, Thinnaa.

01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:24.333
Nemali,

01:29:25.333 --> 01:29:29.166
<i>I’m not like rain. my love and</i>
every thought whirls around you.

01:29:30.375 --> 01:29:31.458
I'm like the breeze.

01:29:32.625 --> 01:29:37.958
<i>My love and heart will be</i>
around you as long as I breathe.

01:29:39.791 --> 01:29:40.791
It's my vow.

01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:45.291
Thinnadi vow!

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.458
<i>“Being half, each other’s half,</i>
from now on, you and me”

01:30:32.666 --> 01:30:37.208
<i>“Let’s be one world, being your</i>
partner, I’m taking a step forward”

01:30:37.416 --> 01:30:41.916
<i>“The sound of both lips is</i>
a kissing battle”

01:30:42.416 --> 01:30:44.541
“The twisted moustache”

01:30:44.750 --> 01:30:47.625
<i>“If the fold around the edge</i>
of waist is pointed out”

01:30:47.833 --> 01:30:51.041
“As long as there is life”

01:30:51.250 --> 01:30:56.666
<i>“I wish us to be together</i>
and share you the hug”

01:30:56.875 --> 01:31:00.708
“As long as there is time”

01:31:00.916 --> 01:31:06.625
<i>“I wish to live with you as</i>
an indelible story”

01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:08.875
What is this for, husband?

01:31:10.166 --> 01:31:11.541
This is to call for you.

01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:15.708
If hit for once, you shall bring me water.

01:31:16.250 --> 01:31:18.458
If hit twice, serve me food.

01:31:19.875 --> 01:31:21.083
What if hit thrice?

01:31:23.583 --> 01:31:24.750
Fulfil my desire!

01:31:25.625 --> 01:31:28.875
So, this will be damaged soon, husband.

01:31:30.166 --> 01:31:31.791
You always hit thrice, right?

01:31:32.958 --> 01:31:38.083
<i>Fine, but if some animal attacks</i>
when I'm gone to forest and you fear...

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.791
bang that hard thrice.

01:31:41.291 --> 01:31:44.333
Wherever I’m, I’ll come immediately. Ok?

01:31:44.875 --> 01:31:49.291
<i>“If I am with you the new age</i>
is killing by being winter”

01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:53.708
“Your breath becoming warm fire”

01:31:53.875 --> 01:31:55.916
“In the streets of flowing waterfall”

01:31:56.125 --> 01:31:58.458
“Shall we take couple baths”

01:31:58.625 --> 01:32:03.125
<i>“Shall we rule the castles</i>
of the heaven?”

01:32:03.333 --> 01:32:07.833
<i>“Even by stealing the time</i>
in next births”

01:32:08.250 --> 01:32:12.375
“Shall I offer you this birth?”

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.458
What is this scribling?

01:32:25.125 --> 01:32:26.583
No husband, don't say so.

01:32:27.125 --> 01:32:30.416
<i>Maybe Vayulingam is like this.</i>
I always dream of it.

01:32:31.375 --> 01:32:33.416
Take me some day and show it to me, husband.

01:32:33.583 --> 01:32:35.666
Should I take you to that stone?

01:32:36.083 --> 01:32:36.916
No way!

01:32:37.875 --> 01:32:39.416
Stop having those crazy dreams.

01:32:42.208 --> 01:32:44.416
“With unbearable grief of being separated”

01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:46.541
“Won’t the breath stop?”

01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:51.166
“If you leave me even in the blink of an eye”

01:32:51.333 --> 01:32:55.750
<i>“Colourful jasmines have</i>
thrown rainbows for us”

01:32:56.208 --> 01:33:00.500
“The night sky made a canopy of moonshine”

01:33:00.708 --> 01:33:05.166
“Soon after the dreaming, it comes true”

01:33:05.375 --> 01:33:09.791
“Is this destiny ours?”

01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:14.875
<i>“Being half, each other’s half,</i>
from now on, you and me”

01:33:15.083 --> 01:33:19.708
<i>“Let’s be one world, being your partner,</i>
I’m taking a step forward”

01:33:19.916 --> 01:33:24.375
“The sound of both lips is a kissing battle”

01:33:24.541 --> 01:33:26.750
“The twisted moustache”

01:33:26.916 --> 01:33:29.541
<i>“If the fold around the edge</i>
of waist is pointed out”

01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:33.500

<i>“I wish us to be together</i>

01:33:39.291 --> 01:33:43.125
“As long as there is time”

<i>“I wish to live with you</i>
as an indelible story”

01:34:29.791 --> 01:34:32.750
<i>Father, Kampadu is here</i>
to share something with you.

01:34:35.416 --> 01:34:39.625
Sir, evil eye has fallen on Vayulingam.

01:34:40.208 --> 01:34:46.833
<i>They are going to attack from Gandhara nation</i>
with one lakh army to take it away.

01:34:47.041 --> 01:34:49.250
Huh, that is impossible.

01:34:50.541 --> 01:34:53.625
<i>His eye fell on Vayulingam</i>
as his time is over.

01:34:54.291 --> 01:34:55.375
Do not worry.

01:34:56.666 --> 01:34:59.916
<i>Saviour of the world knows</i>
very well to save himself.

01:35:01.666 --> 01:35:04.750
Sankara’s army must be ready somewhere.

01:35:06.166 --> 01:35:08.333
Shivoham!

01:35:10.125 --> 01:35:13.333
<i>Nadhanadha, the battle was</i>
on the day the new moon.

01:35:13.375 --> 01:35:16.666
<i>But now even after the full moon</i>
my son is still struggles for life.

01:35:16.708 --> 01:35:19.041
You send word everyday you’ll come to us.

01:35:19.333 --> 01:35:23.166
<i>After we came down, you're saying</i>
to fight together. How is that possible?

01:35:23.333 --> 01:35:29.875
<i>Mundaa. Thinnadu was sent into exile</i>
from this hamlet so we can join forces.

01:35:30.541 --> 01:35:32.375
If we don't fight as one,

01:35:33.166 --> 01:35:36.791
<i>Nadhanadha's sacrifice of his son</i>
will have been for nothing.

01:35:40.291 --> 01:35:41.458
We’re ready.

01:35:42.083 --> 01:35:45.958
<i>Let’s gather our troops back</i>
from their hamlets.

01:36:06.958 --> 01:36:07.625
Oh no!

01:36:09.291 --> 01:36:10.166
Chief!

01:36:22.375 --> 01:36:24.875
Kill everyone. Don’t leave anybody.

01:36:57.291 --> 01:36:58.208
Samba...

01:37:10.375 --> 01:37:14.333
<i>Mali, shift our children and women</i>
to our hideouts that side. -Uncle!

01:37:28.708 --> 01:37:31.665
<i>- Kampadu, you go in support to Mali.</i>
- Hmm.

01:37:31.666 --> 01:37:33.457
Make all our people cross over the bridge.

01:37:33.458 --> 01:37:35.374
<i>It is just the bridge</i>
adjoining these two hills.

01:37:35.375 --> 01:37:38.208
<i>- You crossover first and I’ll come last.</i>
- Ok!

01:37:38.416 --> 01:37:40.875
Cut off the bridge once I crossover.

01:37:41.041 --> 01:37:43.541
<i>- Enemy shouldn’t come that side. Go now.</i>
- Ok!

01:37:50.458 --> 01:37:51.333
Pannaga!

01:37:52.458 --> 01:37:54.958
Come, let’s cross the bridge.

01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:56.291
Come!

01:37:58.041 --> 01:37:58.916
Faster!

01:37:59.958 --> 01:38:00.833
Move!

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:10.833
Come! Faster!

01:38:15.333 --> 01:38:17.250
Come! Faster!

01:38:18.166 --> 01:38:19.000
Move!

01:38:19.625 --> 01:38:20.458
Go!

01:38:21.125 --> 01:38:23.291
<i>- Cross the bridge.</i>
- Come! Come fast.

01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:26.416
<i>- Come.</i>
- Come! Faster!

01:38:31.375 --> 01:38:34.916
<i>Mali, Nathanatha asked to cut off,</i>
once he crosses the bridge.

01:38:35.666 --> 01:38:36.666
Be ready.

01:38:46.583 --> 01:38:47.665
Uncle!

01:38:47.666 --> 01:38:49.333
<i>- Nathanatha, come!</i>
- Come!

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:54.875
Come on!

01:38:59.958 --> 01:39:01.166
Come on!

01:39:06.375 --> 01:39:07.500
Uncle!

01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:28.541
What's wrong, husband?

01:39:56.375 --> 01:39:58.458
Father, what are you doing here?

01:39:58.625 --> 01:40:01.500
I shall open my heart and talk to you...

01:40:01.708 --> 01:40:02.625
What is it Father.

01:40:02.833 --> 01:40:05.750
<i>There's justice and there's</i>
Dharma in the world.

01:40:06.666 --> 01:40:09.291
Dharma is greater than justice.

01:40:10.958 --> 01:40:14.958
Justice exiled you, not Dharma.

01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:17.208
But Dharma always prevails.

01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:21.041
<i>If righteousness is to triumph,</i>
one must live with honesty.

01:40:21.708 --> 01:40:23.708
You possess great honesty.

01:40:24.875 --> 01:40:26.250
Why all this suddenly?

01:40:27.083 --> 01:40:28.041
Shall I tell the truth?

01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:34.000
I learnt archery from you, Thinna.

01:40:34.916 --> 01:40:38.791
<i>We can hit any target</i>
only when the bow and archer’s heart...

01:40:40.416 --> 01:40:44.875
are in unison and I learnt that from you.

01:40:46.333 --> 01:40:51.875
<i>Thinna, not the father always</i>
teaches the kids.

01:40:52.791 --> 01:40:56.166
Father also learns from kids.

01:40:57.416 --> 01:41:01.750
<i>In the wide world, many children</i>
who aspire to be like their fathers,

01:41:02.958 --> 01:41:08.125
but my desire has been to be like you.

01:41:10.375 --> 01:41:15.916
<i>But the child's fate isn't</i>
controlled by their parents.

01:41:16.666 --> 01:41:17.833
Only truth guides it,

01:41:18.291 --> 01:41:25.333
<i>but that remains concealed behind</i>
a shroud of desire, fear, and pride.

01:41:26.833 --> 01:41:30.375
<i>In life, the appearance of future and</i>
past transform moment to moment.

01:41:31.208 --> 01:41:35.375
<i>Learning to prepare for such changes</i>
teaches us the true value of living.

01:41:35.625 --> 01:41:38.625
<i>Greatness isn't found in a man's devotion</i>
to six feet of stone in the form of a statue.

01:41:39.416 --> 01:41:41.041
<i>It abides in the small length</i>
of human tongue.

01:41:42.458 --> 01:41:48.083
<i>So it's essential to perceive with</i>
the love and act with wisdom,

01:41:48.791 --> 01:41:51.791
<i>help the needy,</i>
yet firmly hold back one’s tears.

01:41:53.083 --> 01:41:56.000
Tears should never roll in your eyes.

01:41:58.708 --> 01:41:59.375
Son!

01:42:00.166 --> 01:42:07.541
<i>I told your mother when pregnant that</i>
Sun is taking birth in our race.

01:42:08.333 --> 01:42:13.125
<i>You should be remembered like the Sun</i>
for taking birth in this world with us.

01:42:14.083 --> 01:42:18.041
May my legacy live on in your renown.

01:43:00.833 --> 01:43:01.458
Father...

01:43:35.125 --> 01:43:36.250
Thinna will come.

01:43:47.166 --> 01:43:49.375
Harahara Mahadev!

01:44:43.333 --> 01:44:44.083
Father...

01:45:16.708 --> 01:45:20.541
<i>Your father shines like a beacon</i>
in this jungle valley.

01:45:20.833 --> 01:45:26.541
<i>We feared if we would never find his body,</i>
but the valley led us.

01:45:27.708 --> 01:45:29.875
Nadhanadhudu was a great soul.

01:45:30.333 --> 01:45:35.458
<i>Without a thought to his own safety,</i>
he rescued women and children.

01:45:44.250 --> 01:45:48.250
<i>He who knows he is going to die</i>
yet chooses to sacrifice himself...

01:45:50.041 --> 01:45:51.916
to others is greater than God.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:58.583
<i>We’re losing daylight,</i>
not much time to do what we need to.

01:46:03.291 --> 01:46:13.583
<i>My father's body isn't moving from</i>
here until I kill the one who killed him.

01:46:16.083 --> 01:46:20.625
It's my vow. Thinna's vow.

01:46:28.208 --> 01:46:29.708
So, where's Thinnadu?

01:46:30.166 --> 01:46:34.583
<i>They says he's a courageous hero,</i>
so why's he hiding?

01:46:34.916 --> 01:46:39.416
<i>Can a rabbit hunter challenge you,</i>
My lord Kalamukha?

01:46:59.541 --> 01:47:04.125
<i>Kalamukha! Tomorrow atop Nandi hill</i>
I've already inscribed your fate.

01:47:04.208 --> 01:47:05.333
Come read it for yourself.

01:47:19.958 --> 01:47:21.250
Kill him...

01:47:31.375 --> 01:47:36.791
<i>Kalamukha, throughout many</i>
wars we've killed many warriors.

01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:45.333
<i>Even from so far, in the dark...</i>
he aimed and killed the one by your side.

01:47:45.833 --> 01:47:48.041
Thinnadu is not an ordinary man.

01:47:48.333 --> 01:47:50.333
Listen, let’s retreat back to our land.

01:47:55.041 --> 01:47:59.666
Bappaswamy, we will.

01:48:02.041 --> 01:48:04.208
After we kill Thinnadu...

01:48:06.041 --> 01:48:09.041
And steal Vayulingam...

01:48:11.416 --> 01:48:12.708
We'll go back...

01:48:47.958 --> 01:48:51.000
“Thinnadu jumped into the war”

01:48:53.208 --> 01:48:56.625
“It’s an end to the monster creed”

01:48:58.833 --> 01:49:02.333
“Blood will now flow as a river”

01:49:04.291 --> 01:49:07.750
<i>“This is a war never witnessed</i>
even by the Sun”

01:49:15.666 --> 01:49:18.625
“He’s the fire born in the forest”

01:49:21.250 --> 01:49:24.250
<i>“This is the ferocious</i>
man slaughter by Arjun”

01:49:26.666 --> 01:49:29.541
“This is a never ending thirst of war”

01:49:32.291 --> 01:49:35.125
<i>“Thinnadu’s slaughter</i>
will not stop now”

01:49:39.708 --> 01:49:44.875
<i>“Hail to the leader walking into</i> the war”

01:49:45.416 --> 01:49:50.791
“Fight with all your powers on high”

01:49:50.958 --> 01:49:56.041
“Anyone in the opposition is gone now”

01:49:56.625 --> 01:49:58.708
“This is the ferociousness”

01:49:59.333 --> 01:50:02.291
“He’ll create a scary destruction now”

01:50:41.583 --> 01:50:43.041
"May you be the winner"

01:50:45.833 --> 01:50:47.166
"May you be the winner"

01:50:50.583 --> 01:50:53.958
"Lord Shiva, whose head is glorified
By the moving waves of the celestial river"

01:50:54.041 --> 01:50:56.958
"Agitating in the deep well of his flirting locks"

01:50:57.291 --> 01:51:00.416
"One who has the brilliant fire"

01:51:00.625 --> 01:51:04.708
"Flaming on the surface of his forehead
and the crescent moon on his head"

01:51:05.125 --> 01:51:06.250
Hail Shiva...

01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:08.000
"Shivoham"

01:51:11.125 --> 01:51:16.208
"Namah Shivaya... Sadha Shivaya...
Maheswaraya... Shiva Shivaya... "

01:51:16.458 --> 01:51:20.250
"Namah Shivaya... Sadha Shivaya...
Maheswaraya... "

01:51:26.416 --> 01:51:29.000
This is our last battle.

01:52:24.916 --> 01:52:25.708
Thinna...

01:52:45.166 --> 01:52:46.291
My Thinna will come.

01:53:02.083 --> 01:53:02.916
Thinna!

01:53:03.333 --> 01:53:04.625
Hey...

01:53:04.791 --> 01:53:06.416
- Thinna!
- Thinna!

01:53:06.458 --> 01:53:07.208
Thinna!

01:53:07.291 --> 01:53:08.916
- Thinna!
- Thinna!

01:53:08.958 --> 01:53:09.875
Thinna!

01:53:10.166 --> 01:53:13.666
- Thinna!
- Thinna!

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:15.166
I got my revenge.

01:53:16.666 --> 01:53:19.458
But I couldn’t bring my father back.

01:53:20.333 --> 01:53:21.791
- Thinna!
- Thinna!

01:54:00.708 --> 01:54:01.750
Stop Thinna!

01:54:07.166 --> 01:54:09.666
<i>This is your hamlet.</i>
We are all your people.

01:54:10.666 --> 01:54:12.333
<i>You are the chief of this hamlet.</i>

01:54:12.666 --> 01:54:13.833
Don’t leave.

01:54:14.250 --> 01:54:15.208
Please stay back.

01:54:16.208 --> 01:54:19.333
<i>My father’s final word was for me</i>
to leave the Hamlet.

01:54:20.250 --> 01:54:22.583
Alive or not, his word is his word.

01:54:44.416 --> 01:54:45.791
Om Namahsivaya!

01:54:47.625 --> 01:54:48.916
<i>- What’s this, Nemali?</i>
- Om Namahsivaya!

01:54:49.250 --> 01:54:53.041
<i>You started this morning even</i>
before I brought a log?

01:54:53.666 --> 01:54:55.416
Today is Shiva's Night, Darling.

01:54:55.666 --> 01:54:59.083
Why call it night when this is clearly day.

01:54:59.166 --> 01:55:01.708
- What gives? Have you eaten anything?
- Om Namahsivaya!

01:55:03.583 --> 01:55:06.666
<i>I told, you today is Shivarathri.</i>
A day of fasting.

01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:11.083
<i>For you I could fast for rest of</i>
my life if you asked.

01:55:11.333 --> 01:55:13.166
But not for that rock.

01:55:14.708 --> 01:55:18.125
<i>You say you didn't make</i>
breakfast but there's kheer.

01:55:19.333 --> 01:55:21.000
<i>- I'm hungry. I'll have it.</i>
- Stop. That's for Shiva.

01:55:21.083 --> 01:55:22.041
Hey, hey...

01:55:24.416 --> 01:55:26.750
Why'd you do that?

01:55:26.958 --> 01:55:28.791
I told you that's for Shiva.

01:55:29.041 --> 01:55:30.666
Is it wrong to eat when I'm hungry?

01:55:31.041 --> 01:55:33.833
<i>This craziness won’t stop</i>
until I chuck this rock into the forest.

01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:35.541
Stop there, my love.

01:55:36.250 --> 01:55:38.375
<i>I won't argue if you toss me</i>
into the wilderness,

01:55:39.208 --> 01:55:40.833
but don't lay a hand on Shiva!

01:55:41.041 --> 01:55:41.875
What?

01:55:42.541 --> 01:55:45.666
<i>You didn’t show such sorrow</i>
after leaving your parents and your home,

01:55:45.708 --> 01:55:47.125
but now you weep for this stone?

01:55:47.583 --> 01:55:49.500
Is this rock more important to you than me?

01:55:49.791 --> 01:55:51.250
Why are you so stubborn, man?

01:55:52.291 --> 01:55:53.333
Stubborn?

01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:56.375
I’m stubborn? You’re talking nonsense.

01:55:56.791 --> 01:56:00.166
<i>Like everyone who believes in this stone.</i>
You’re going crazy.

01:56:00.708 --> 01:56:04.458
<i>Where is he? What he look like?</i>
What does he do? Have you ever seen him?

01:56:04.666 --> 01:56:05.458
Tell me.

01:56:07.125 --> 01:56:10.250
<i>Don't talk like that.</i>
Shiva is everywhere.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.750
<i>He gave us our births.</i>
He is the cause of everything...

01:56:14.041 --> 01:56:16.500
Oh, sure, the rock does all that.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.166
He sets forests on fire.

01:56:19.583 --> 01:56:22.541
<i>He withholds rain so the crops</i>
fail and people starve.

01:56:23.041 --> 01:56:27.541
<i>The rock is behind</i>
the suffering of all mankind.

01:56:27.833 --> 01:56:28.750
Do I have that right?

01:56:28.958 --> 01:56:33.250
<i>I don't have the answers to the</i>
mysteries of good and bad.

01:56:35.791 --> 01:56:37.625
But Shiva exists. That’s the truth.

01:56:37.833 --> 01:56:38.916
It’s all big lie

01:56:39.458 --> 01:56:42.958
<i>You can’t touch it, it never hears you,</i>
it never talks to you.

01:56:43.041 --> 01:56:44.000
Just one big lie.

01:56:44.708 --> 01:56:46.916
<i>Did you test me for reality</i>
before you fell in love with me?

01:56:47.166 --> 01:56:49.000
Then why put Shiva to the test?

01:56:49.125 --> 01:56:52.207
<i>I saw you with my eyes.</i>
Fell in love with you.

01:56:52.208 --> 01:56:53.416
<i>- That’s not ...</i>
- Anyways...

01:56:53.708 --> 01:56:56.541
<i>I’ll go and hunt a tender deer</i>
and bring it back.

01:56:56.625 --> 01:56:58.583
<i>We'll prepare it and eat it together.</i>
Be ready to cook.

01:56:58.750 --> 01:57:01.791
<i>Fine, go.</i>
Even an ant doesn’t sting unless Shiva wills.

01:57:02.791 --> 01:57:05.500
Are you challenging me?

01:57:06.166 --> 01:57:07.916
Let me see how I don't get the hunt.

01:57:08.333 --> 01:57:09.958
I'm not coming home if I don't get one.

01:57:20.458 --> 01:57:22.125
Oh Master of world drama.

01:57:22.291 --> 01:57:27.250
<i>You said Thinnadu, an atheist,</i>
will bring Vayulinga to the world.

01:57:27.458 --> 01:57:31.250
<i>He’s bound to Nemali,</i>
who by her nature is devoted to you.

01:57:31.625 --> 01:57:35.958
<i>Mahadeva Shastri, who prevents the public</i>
from seeing and taking darshan with Vayulinga,

01:57:36.125 --> 01:57:37.583
stands as an immovable obstacle.

01:57:37.708 --> 01:57:41.041
<i>One doesn’t believe...</i>
the other can’t help believing you,

01:57:41.208 --> 01:57:43.666
and the third guards the faith.

01:57:44.458 --> 01:57:45.458
How is this supposed to happen?

01:57:45.708 --> 01:57:51.958
<i>Shivani, these three riddles are</i>
the keys to Shiva's secret.

01:57:52.875 --> 01:57:56.125
<i>As each is unlocked,</i>
the secret is revealed.

01:57:56.666 --> 01:58:03.416
<i>Is that why you created a huge tiff</i>
in that loving couple for a small matter?

01:58:03.625 --> 01:58:07.375
Small matters always lead to a big change.

01:58:07.875 --> 01:58:13.375
<i>But, we as parents should show</i>
the right path to the kids.

01:58:14.958 --> 01:58:17.875
When did I say no to you, Parvathi?

01:58:18.625 --> 01:58:20.583
During this Shivaratri,

01:58:21.666 --> 01:58:28.791
<i>before the end of evolvement of the linga,</i>
Thinnadu must say 'Shivayya' at least once.

01:58:29.583 --> 01:58:34.041
<i>Otherwise, no matter how many times</i>
he's reincarnated, he will never join with me.

01:58:34.250 --> 01:58:35.791
What is this twist again Swami?

01:58:49.458 --> 01:58:50.541
Rudra...

01:58:55.333 --> 01:58:57.250
Harahara Mahadev!

01:59:02.250 --> 01:59:03.458
At your order, my Lord!

01:59:43.541 --> 01:59:45.583
<i>He'll come back when hungry.</i>
Stubborn man!

01:59:50.875 --> 01:59:53.083
<i>- What, man?</i>
- Where is Nemali?

01:59:53.291 --> 01:59:56.750
<i>Why think of her now?</i>
She's elsewhere. Married.

01:59:57.125 --> 01:59:59.500
Just be happy you've recovered.

02:00:00.541 --> 02:00:01.499
She's married?

02:00:01.500 --> 02:00:02.333
What, man?

02:00:03.458 --> 02:00:05.000
I still won't let go.

02:00:06.333 --> 02:00:10.541
I’ll never be at peace until I violate her.

02:00:10.750 --> 02:00:12.250
Hey! Wrong, Son.

02:00:12.416 --> 02:00:16.166
<i>By our village tradition a married woman</i>
is the same as a mother.

02:00:16.375 --> 02:00:19.041
<i>You were thought dead</i>
when he defeated you.

02:00:19.083 --> 02:00:20.208
Are you eager to die again?

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.166
Instead of urging me to kill him,

02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:30.625
<i>- you say I’m dead? You...</i>
- Hey, I'm your father.

02:00:30.916 --> 02:00:32.250
No, no.

02:01:26.375 --> 02:01:28.250
Namo Bhuthanatha.

02:01:29.291 --> 02:01:31.166
Namo Shakthiswarupa.

02:01:32.083 --> 02:01:34.125
Namo Vayulingeswara.

02:01:35.250 --> 02:01:36.875
This is your night. Mahashiva

02:01:38.125 --> 02:01:41.333
<i>The night, when you do your</i>
sacred dance on Mount Kailasa.

02:01:43.125 --> 02:01:49.500
<i>The Universe worships you on</i>
this auspicious night of Shivarathri...

02:01:51.708 --> 02:01:52.708
Oh Lord of Time.

02:01:54.666 --> 02:02:00.583
<i>Bless me that my ritual</i>
be carried out uninterrupted.

02:02:02.416 --> 02:02:03.833
Supreme Lord!

02:02:09.958 --> 02:02:13.583
“Victory, victory to Rudra!”

02:02:13.791 --> 02:02:17.208
<i>“The fearless, victorious</i>
and auspicious one!”

02:02:17.708 --> 02:02:21.250
<i>“The one with eyes like</i>
the rays of the sun”

02:02:23.833 --> 02:02:27.041
<i>“The poison-throated one,</i>
I seek refuge in you”

02:02:27.208 --> 02:02:31.166
“Your Incarnation - is like a sunbeam”

02:02:31.750 --> 02:02:35.208
“Your movement - destroys fear”

02:02:35.625 --> 02:02:40.166
<i>“Your feet moves, your gaze</i>
changes all ten directions”

02:02:46.666 --> 02:02:50.541
<i>Shiva! Blow away the fog of</i>
that clouds Thinnadu's mind.

02:02:51.083 --> 02:02:57.125
<i>“This wind is thrilled with</i>
the shoulder strength of your word dust”

02:02:57.458 --> 02:03:03.125
<i>“The rainy wind cannot beat your truth-</i>
play that bears elephant strength”

02:03:03.458 --> 02:03:09.125
<i>“The sight of you, O Lord,</i>
has made this earth entranced.”

02:03:09.416 --> 02:03:15.875
<i>“Hey messenger of Shiva’s compassionate</i>
rhythm, stepping on the earth”

02:03:28.416 --> 02:03:30.291
<i>- Did you call?</i>
- Oh no!

02:03:30.791 --> 02:03:32.208
Who the hell are you?

02:03:32.458 --> 02:03:35.375
Idiot! How did you come here?

02:03:35.583 --> 02:03:38.625
You dare set eyes upon my holy Vayulinga?

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.583
Kampa! Kampa!

02:03:41.666 --> 02:03:43.000
Why so angry?

02:03:43.875 --> 02:03:47.458
<i>You can whisper lovingly.</i>
Kampadu can't hear you...

02:03:48.333 --> 02:03:53.083
<i>I handled everything</i>
before coming here, Shastri.

02:03:53.291 --> 02:03:56.041
How dare you speak to me that way?

02:03:56.458 --> 02:03:58.291
Do you know who I am?

02:03:59.041 --> 02:04:01.791
None other than the Agasthya vamsha samjaatha,

02:04:02.333 --> 02:04:04.708
<i>aghoramukha archanaa vidhi</i>
vidhaana nishnaatha veda vedaanga

02:04:04.750 --> 02:04:09.500
<i>paaritha Samstha loka janahitha...</i>
parameshti hrudhaya pariveshtitha...

02:04:09.666 --> 02:04:13.333
<i>Bakhthaagresara,</i>
bhoosura panditha Mahadeva Shastri.

02:04:13.666 --> 02:04:14.583
Oh my!

02:04:16.375 --> 02:04:19.000
It is as long as Shiva’s unwound hair.

02:04:19.708 --> 02:04:20.791
I can't call you that.

02:04:21.583 --> 02:04:25.791
<i>Something like "grampa" or</i>
"gramps" would be better.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.625
Silence! No one may enter this place.

02:04:29.375 --> 02:04:31.083
It is tradition. It is law.

02:04:31.166 --> 02:04:33.041
<i>You must be the one who</i>
wrote that inscription, too.

02:04:33.250 --> 02:04:34.791
Hold your tongue!

02:04:35.416 --> 02:04:39.125
<i>Those are Shastras written by sages.</i>
Men rich in sacred energy. Inscriptions!

02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:41.458
Letters are no more than weapons.

02:04:41.500 --> 02:04:44.250
Did you create that alphabet and language?

02:04:45.041 --> 02:04:47.416
Or did it your grandparents?

02:04:49.541 --> 02:04:53.500
<i>At the time of The Twilight Ritual,</i>
on top of Mount Kailasa,

02:04:53.541 --> 02:04:58.333
<i>when Parameshwara did the sacred dance,</i>
letters were born from the Symphony of Drums.

02:04:59.166 --> 02:05:00.875
Thus Language was born.

02:05:01.291 --> 02:05:05.208
<i>Devotion was born even before</i>
these languages and grammar...

02:05:09.458 --> 02:05:10.416
Shastri...

02:05:11.291 --> 02:05:16.375
<i>It seems your silk garments are more preferred</i>
by Agni, lord of Fire, than by Shiva.

02:05:17.375 --> 02:05:18.416
Look there.

02:05:22.250 --> 02:05:23.250
It is all gone!

02:05:23.500 --> 02:05:27.208
Parameshwara.. parameshwara...

02:05:27.583 --> 02:05:29.791
My Lord, Kailsanatha...

02:05:30.500 --> 02:05:32.958
Parameshwara.. parameshwara...

02:05:33.250 --> 02:05:34.083
My Lord...

02:05:36.500 --> 02:05:39.583
Forgive the sins my Lord...

02:05:40.125 --> 02:05:41.250
Parameshwara...

02:05:41.458 --> 02:05:43.916
Om Namah Shivaya...

02:05:46.541 --> 02:05:50.833
Harahara Mahadeva Shambho Shankara!

02:05:54.291 --> 02:05:55.791
Swami.. Who are you?

02:05:56.416 --> 02:05:57.750
I am just like you but...

02:05:59.041 --> 02:06:00.875
I have never seen you Swami.

02:06:01.041 --> 02:06:03.875
<i>I’ve been near,</i>
but you wouldn’t have noticed me.

02:06:04.291 --> 02:06:07.250
I'm hungry. Anything to eat?

02:06:16.750 --> 02:06:17.416
Swami...

02:06:18.416 --> 02:06:20.666
<i>Today is Shivarathri.</i>
It's a fasting day.

02:06:21.250 --> 02:06:23.500
<i>I didn’t even let my husband</i>
touch the prasad.

02:06:24.041 --> 02:06:27.375
<i>The caretaker of the home</i>
should feed God and husband?

02:06:28.541 --> 02:06:30.875
<i>The Goddess of Sustenance is</i>
the one who feeds Shiva.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:34.708
<i>Swami...</i>
I'm telling to you.

02:06:42.958 --> 02:06:45.416
By the way, who taught you this?

02:06:45.625 --> 02:06:46.375
Elders.

02:06:46.458 --> 02:06:47.416
And who taught them?

02:06:47.500 --> 02:06:48.500
Elder elders.

02:06:51.916 --> 02:06:54.125
Well, I'm older than the eldest.

02:06:54.750 --> 02:06:56.708
Do you blindly believe whatever I say?

02:07:06.541 --> 02:07:07.250
OI!

02:07:07.791 --> 02:07:09.375
Who are you... kicking me?

02:07:11.625 --> 02:07:13.208
It was an accident.

02:07:13.833 --> 02:07:16.458
<i>As I was coming toward you</i>
I thought you were alone.

02:07:16.958 --> 02:07:18.625
Thought maybe to have word with you.

02:07:19.541 --> 02:07:21.875
<i>What's this talking when I'm feeling</i>
so hungry? Get going.

02:07:25.041 --> 02:07:26.083
Oh, I will!

02:07:27.375 --> 02:07:29.833
At whom are you angry, though?

02:07:32.500 --> 02:07:36.625
<i>None of your business. Huh?</i>
What help would you be?

02:07:37.541 --> 02:07:39.750
The woman I married won’t let me eat.

02:07:40.708 --> 02:07:42.500
It seems today is Shivarathri.

02:07:42.750 --> 02:07:44.750
<i>I have to bow down to some rock</i>
she worships, I guess.

02:07:44.958 --> 02:07:47.083
And I have to call it a specific name, huh!

02:07:50.291 --> 02:07:51.333
What's the problem?

02:07:52.541 --> 02:07:57.458
Once you say ‘Shivayya’ you’ll find game.

02:07:57.833 --> 02:07:59.250
Your hunger will be satisfied.

02:08:00.250 --> 02:08:02.250
Your marital squabble will be settled.

02:08:03.125 --> 02:08:07.000
Aha! Nemali sent you, eh?

02:08:08.708 --> 02:08:10.291
You don't know about me.

02:08:11.041 --> 02:08:12.625
I don't listen to anyone.

02:08:13.166 --> 02:08:15.000
I won't say the rock's name.

02:08:15.458 --> 02:08:17.666
We'll see about the hunting.

02:08:19.541 --> 02:08:21.958
<i>I won’t let your Shivratri</i>
observance be spoiled.

02:08:23.125 --> 02:08:27.416
Can I give you some clothes?

02:08:27.833 --> 02:08:28.791
No no no!

02:08:29.500 --> 02:08:32.250
<i>Not just any old fabric</i>
can be offered to Crowned one.

02:08:32.541 --> 02:08:36.750
Only silk, the most sacred and sublime!

02:08:37.375 --> 02:08:44.208
Doesn’t that sacred silk come from a worm?

02:08:45.666 --> 02:08:50.583
<i>The waters of the holy Ganga you have there,</i>
don’t the fish make it impure?

02:08:51.666 --> 02:08:53.875
<i>And the milk foam you anointed</i>
the lingam with,

02:08:54.791 --> 02:08:57.833
do you know which calf had its mouth on it?

02:08:59.791 --> 02:09:02.208
Have you offered that spittle to Shiva?

02:09:02.291 --> 02:09:05.083
What? Lord Shiva didn’t call it spittle.

02:09:05.250 --> 02:09:08.333
<i>Who the heck are you to cast</i>
doubts my devotion?

02:09:08.416 --> 02:09:09.625
Is this devotion?

02:09:10.750 --> 02:09:14.833
<i>Who are you to hide this Vayulinga</i>
behind a tree or under a catacomb?

02:09:15.958 --> 02:09:19.541
<i>An incomparable devotee will arise</i>
to strip away your layers of ego.

02:09:20.458 --> 02:09:22.791
<i>Soon you will learn</i>
the true essence of devotion.

02:09:24.083 --> 02:09:28.666
<i>There is no greater Shiva devotee</i>
than me in all creation.

02:09:50.166 --> 02:09:52.708
Fasting means not punishing the gut.

02:09:53.500 --> 02:09:55.208
It means being closer to God.

02:09:55.375 --> 02:09:57.625
Different methods for each individual.

02:09:58.291 --> 02:10:01.083
You can’t force devotion on someone.

02:10:01.791 --> 02:10:02.583
Swami...

02:10:03.291 --> 02:10:04.541
I don’t know who you are,

02:10:05.416 --> 02:10:07.625
<i>but you talk like a maniac</i>
just like my Thinnadu.

02:10:07.958 --> 02:10:10.458
<i>It takes a man with a brain</i>
to talk with heated passion.

02:10:10.791 --> 02:10:12.916
That's why he likes Thinnadu...

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:17.833
<i>Swami, if you see my Darling on</i>
your way, tell him to come home...

02:10:19.166 --> 02:10:21.958
<i>It’s my job to guide</i>
those who have gone astray.

02:10:26.750 --> 02:10:29.125
You argued like this with your wife.

02:10:29.791 --> 02:10:32.625
<i>No one’s in a good mood</i>
after quarrelling with his wife.

02:10:33.125 --> 02:10:35.291
<i>So much talk.</i>
Are you married?

02:10:36.666 --> 02:10:38.375
Why do you ask?

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.833
<i>Huh, you got uptight</i>
as soon as I asked if you were married.

02:10:42.250 --> 02:10:43.833
If you were married, you'd know.

02:10:44.125 --> 02:10:47.791
<i>Once that chain is around your neck</i>
it’s not a bond that can be easily broken.

02:10:49.500 --> 02:10:52.500
Is that a God’s chain around your neck?

02:10:53.541 --> 02:10:55.458
This is in memory of my best friend.

02:10:56.333 --> 02:11:00.333
And proof that there is no God.

02:11:00.958 --> 02:11:08.125
<i>When that chain breaks,</i>
then you'll see God everywhere.

02:11:11.625 --> 02:11:13.125
Not in this life.

02:11:19.166 --> 02:11:23.708
<i>Wait, wait...</i>
that stone looks like a Shiva Lingam...

02:11:24.916 --> 02:11:27.791
<i>Oh? If I put up my foot,</i>
will he strike me with lightning?

02:11:28.333 --> 02:11:30.958
<i>Let him try...</i>
I'll take care of him...

02:11:33.750 --> 02:11:38.666
<i>Shiva himself should come down for that?</i>
I all that deserves.

02:12:49.583 --> 02:12:54.500
Nemali, I’ll have you now.

02:13:45.333 --> 02:13:49.125
Nemali, see how I smoke you out.

02:15:47.416 --> 02:15:49.333
Om Namah Shivaya..!

02:15:51.333 --> 02:15:52.875
I keep missing target.

02:15:53.458 --> 02:15:54.375
Not missing...

02:15:56.833 --> 02:15:58.166
You claimed there is no God,

02:15:58.958 --> 02:16:02.375
<i>yet you performed all that's required</i>
on Shivarathri just like a great devotee.

02:16:03.208 --> 02:16:06.583
<i>You broke a coconut for this stone.</i>
That completes the puja.

02:16:06.958 --> 02:16:08.625
Me? Puja?

02:16:09.333 --> 02:16:10.333
Who did what now?

02:16:12.500 --> 02:16:15.333
Look how you have honored the Vayulinga.

02:16:21.208 --> 02:16:22.375
Vayulinga...!?

02:16:23.791 --> 02:16:28.208
<i>For this, you drowned in the river</i>
on the day of Mahashivratri...

02:16:31.916 --> 02:16:34.000
You applied sacred ash.

02:16:39.791 --> 02:16:41.958
You made the offering of bilva leaves.

02:16:45.250 --> 02:16:47.375
You fasted saying you refuse to fast.

02:16:48.458 --> 02:16:49.833
You were alert and kept vigil.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:53.416
I took it for mule headedness.

02:16:54.666 --> 02:16:58.375
<i>But You and your God are in</i>
cahoots on this crime.

02:17:01.166 --> 02:17:03.833
He is not a partner in crime nor a cahoots.

02:17:04.125 --> 02:17:05.791
We have nothing to do with each other.

02:17:08.500 --> 02:17:11.250
<i>You battled against the usurpers</i>
of Vayulinga even though you...

02:17:11.458 --> 02:17:13.416
have nothing to do with each other?

02:17:14.791 --> 02:17:16.750
<i>Didn’t you kill hundreds</i>
for the same reason?

02:17:17.833 --> 02:17:19.958
I fought in my father's honour.

02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:28.166
<i>Well, he's also the father...</i>
Father of the world...

02:17:31.875 --> 02:17:36.166
<i>the only thing left is saying</i>
'Shivayya' in your heart.

02:17:36.833 --> 02:17:39.166
He'll fulfil all your desires.

02:17:50.708 --> 02:17:52.458
Where will you run?

02:17:53.875 --> 02:17:56.458
I’ll never stop hunting you.

02:18:02.541 --> 02:18:03.250
Nemali...

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:41.833
Nemali...

02:18:43.250 --> 02:18:44.125
Nemali...

02:18:44.791 --> 02:18:45.791
Nemali...

02:20:55.083 --> 02:20:56.041
Nemali...

02:20:57.250 --> 02:20:58.250
Nemali...

02:21:39.750 --> 02:21:40.750
Nemali!

02:21:47.416 --> 02:21:48.416
What happened?

02:21:53.041 --> 02:21:54.958
Can't find your wife?

02:21:55.333 --> 02:21:56.791
Yes! I searched the whole forest.

02:21:58.083 --> 02:22:00.708
<i>I see elephant's footprints I've</i>
never seen before.

02:22:01.541 --> 02:22:06.750
<i>Snakes and spider's nests</i>
spreading far and wide.

02:22:08.833 --> 02:22:11.291
I thought this forest was under my command.

02:22:12.833 --> 02:22:16.375
But I couldn’t trace Nemali, my life.

02:22:18.416 --> 02:22:19.958
I don't get it.

02:22:21.291 --> 02:22:23.125
Not everything makes sense to everyone.

02:22:24.083 --> 02:22:27.291
<i>Sometimes devotion is its own</i>
strength, and more.

02:22:29.291 --> 02:22:33.500
<i>In your heart,</i>
call Shiva who commands all worlds.

02:22:34.333 --> 02:22:36.041
You may find your Nemali.

02:22:38.125 --> 02:22:39.875
You've tried everything.

02:22:41.083 --> 02:22:43.083
As a last resort, just once try asking Shiva.

02:22:44.875 --> 02:22:49.083
<i>The Innocent Shankara will not turn you</i>
down if asked with all your heart.

02:23:27.791 --> 02:23:29.708
<i>I don’t know</i>
if everyone is saying that rock is God.

02:23:31.083 --> 02:23:35.125
or God is the rock.

02:23:37.458 --> 02:23:39.625
<i>Nemali believes in you.</i>
And she believed in me.

02:23:41.833 --> 02:23:45.750
But she argued with me because of you.

02:23:47.458 --> 02:23:51.291
So today you mean more to her.

02:23:52.583 --> 02:23:56.958
<i>Everyone believes you exist.</i>
But, I never believed.

02:24:00.125 --> 02:24:02.583
I haven't asked you for anything.

02:24:03.416 --> 02:24:05.375
I am asking you this just this once.

02:24:07.291 --> 02:24:13.833
<i>If you do exist, show me where</i>
I can find my Nemali. "Shivayyaa..."

02:24:34.666 --> 02:24:35.833
The magic of Shiva!

02:24:44.875 --> 02:24:45.541
Nemali...

02:25:02.833 --> 02:25:03.916
Nemali...

02:25:04.500 --> 02:25:05.333
Nemali...

02:25:05.583 --> 02:25:06.375
Nemali...

02:25:07.083 --> 02:25:08.458
<i>Nemali...</i>
- My love.

02:25:11.750 --> 02:25:14.583
Forgive me. I can't live without you.

02:25:16.625 --> 02:25:20.083
<i>Nemali! You always keep thinking</i>
about Vayulinga, right?

02:25:21.083 --> 02:25:23.291
<i>The Vayulingam, it's here.</i>
He was the one...

02:25:39.500 --> 02:25:47.583
<i>Swami! You finally showed mercy and</i>
brought my Darling and me together.

02:25:48.250 --> 02:25:49.291
I bow to you, Swami...

02:25:50.291 --> 02:25:54.833
<i>My love, bring me there every day,</i>
so I can do puja.

02:25:55.958 --> 02:25:57.875
Why go all that way every day?

02:25:58.041 --> 02:26:01.291
I’ll just carry bring this to our place...

02:26:02.916 --> 02:26:04.583
Love... Come on, Darling, it's wrong.

02:27:21.500 --> 02:27:22.916
<i>Let's leave.</i>
Come, my love.

02:27:34.583 --> 02:27:37.125
<i>Let's come with flowers and fruits</i>
tomorrow and worship. Come, dear.

02:29:04.166 --> 02:29:05.250
I was wrong.

02:29:07.583 --> 02:29:09.000
Terribly wrong.

02:29:11.916 --> 02:29:14.750
<i>I didn’t realize you were there</i>
all this time.

02:29:17.708 --> 02:29:19.625
I wasted my life.

02:29:22.708 --> 02:29:25.625
I could not say the little word ‘Shiva’.

02:29:28.541 --> 02:29:29.833
I called you a rock.

02:29:31.750 --> 02:29:34.500
<i>I said if I ever saw you,</i>
I make you pay.

02:29:36.416 --> 02:29:38.375
But you were not angry with me.

02:29:41.750 --> 02:29:48.416
<i>Now I understand that in my words,</i>
in my hunt, my call,

02:29:48.625 --> 02:29:52.791
my remembrance... in my victory...

02:29:56.166 --> 02:29:59.291
I failed to recognize you in all of it.

02:30:02.833 --> 02:30:05.125
<i>Until last night!</i>
From the moment I touched you,

02:30:06.583 --> 02:30:11.333
I remembered you and forgot myself.

02:30:15.208 --> 02:30:16.500
My mother's dea...

02:30:23.583 --> 02:30:29.916
<i>The sadness in me since my mother</i>
died is gone with your touch.

02:30:32.791 --> 02:30:36.666
<i>I was lonely when my father</i>
who stood behind me departed.

02:30:40.041 --> 02:30:44.833
<i>But now I know you also stood</i>
behind me.

02:30:50.250 --> 02:30:55.958
Shivayya, Now I am born again.

02:30:58.250 --> 02:31:00.791
<i>Now everywhere I look,</i>
I see you and nothing else.

02:31:03.375 --> 02:31:05.375
Rain drop, the rice plant,

02:31:06.833 --> 02:31:09.541
Bull’s hump, temple tower,

02:31:10.708 --> 02:31:13.125
bilva branch, blackberry,

02:31:16.666 --> 02:31:21.166
breath pump, cow’s udder, mother’s breast,

02:31:22.083 --> 02:31:23.500
sky, earth...

02:31:24.125 --> 02:31:27.250
<i>All appears in the likeness</i>
of a Lingam Shivayya.

02:31:31.166 --> 02:31:32.416
How many names?

02:31:33.333 --> 02:31:34.666
How many forms?

02:31:37.416 --> 02:31:39.666
Are you small and invisible?

02:31:41.541 --> 02:31:43.041
Or too big to see?

02:31:48.125 --> 02:31:49.790
Pain is not known until it is felt.

02:31:49.791 --> 02:31:52.375
<i>Life is unknown</i>
until it comes into experience.

02:31:57.041 --> 02:31:58.625
From now on I’ll never leave you alone.

02:32:00.458 --> 02:32:02.000
You are my life...

02:32:04.583 --> 02:32:05.541
It is my vow.

02:32:07.416 --> 02:32:08.666
Thinna’s vow.

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.625
“My wisdom eye has opened up”

02:32:30.791 --> 02:32:32.208
“Oh Shiva Lingam”

02:32:32.416 --> 02:32:34.916
“My heart has learnt about you”

02:32:35.083 --> 02:32:36.666
<i>“The blindfold made of</i>
illusions has been removed”

02:32:36.875 --> 02:32:39.125
“My wisdom eye has opened up”

02:32:39.333 --> 02:32:40.583
“Oh Shiva Lingam”

02:32:40.791 --> 02:32:43.250
“My heart has learnt about you”

02:32:43.458 --> 02:32:45.041
<i>“The blindfold made of illusions</i>
has been removed”

02:32:45.250 --> 02:32:49.583
<i>“My old life has passed without ever</i>
to know about the sand and the Sun”

02:32:49.791 --> 02:32:53.833
<i>“I am tired until now as I passed</i>
my life denying your existence”

02:32:54.041 --> 02:32:57.958
<i>“Apply your grace as</i>
sacred ash on my body”

02:32:58.166 --> 02:33:02.250

02:42:06.375 --> 02:42:08.416
No more talk with him, Father.

02:42:09.083 --> 02:42:11.000

Beat him harder...

Thinna...

02:43:40.625 --> 02:43:41.875
What is this, my love?

What is so awful now.

02:45:28.041 --> 02:45:29.666
Oh. Is it because they beat me?

02:45:31.541 --> 02:45:33.666
Shivayya, can I tell you a secret?

02:45:34.208 --> 02:45:38.333
<i>Their blows were not even</i>
as painful as an ant sting.

02:45:38.666 --> 02:45:39.541
Promise!

02:45:40.250 --> 02:45:43.833

What can I do?

02:46:03.208 --> 02:46:05.333
What can I do?

02:46:07.791 --> 02:46:09.666
I got an idea.

02:46:10.500 --> 02:46:12.166
The medicine you taught us, Shivayya.

02:46:13.500 --> 02:46:16.916
<i>You replaced Ganesha's head</i>
with an elephant's.

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:21.041
Now I will replace your eye with mine.

02:46:21.666 --> 02:46:22.333
Huh!

02:46:58.125 --> 02:46:59.625
Shiva’s eye has stopped bleeding.

02:47:00.041 --> 02:47:03.333

Shiva’s eye has stopped bleeding.

02:47:13.166 --> 02:47:15.166
Crazy lady seems to be frightened.

02:47:20.708 --> 02:47:21.833
What?? Shivayya!

02:47:22.791 --> 02:47:24.500
Blood from your second eye?

02:47:28.333 --> 02:47:32.083
Not to worry, now I know what to do,

02:47:32.625 --> 02:47:35.708
Give you my other eye for yours.

02:47:37.166 --> 02:47:44.375
<i>But, Shivayya don’t let the third eye</i>
start bleeding. I’m all out of eyes.

02:47:50.708 --> 02:47:51.791
One second, Shivayya...

02:47:58.083 --> 02:47:58.916
Nemali,

02:47:59.958 --> 02:48:03.958
<i>I told you that I will keep you always</i>
in my eyes and look after you.

02:48:05.041 --> 02:48:06.958
But I’m breaking my word for Shiva’s sake.

02:48:08.416 --> 02:48:09.500
Forgive me Nemali.

02:48:11.333 --> 02:48:14.625
But Shivayya is there to look after you right?

02:48:15.666 --> 02:48:17.583
You will look after her, won't you?

02:48:33.291 --> 02:48:34.333
Shivayya...

This life is blessed, father.

Don't get angry, Swami!

02:48:57.458 --> 02:48:59.250
I'll remove my leg in a jiffy.

02:48:59.666 --> 02:49:04.666

where your eye is, Lord.

02:49:38.125 --> 02:49:38.875

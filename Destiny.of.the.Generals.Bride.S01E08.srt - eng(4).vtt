=Destiny of the General's Bride=

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.020
=Episode 8=

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:19.960
How is it, sir?

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.519
Why does my wife keep having a fever?

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:25.960
Animals often carry filth
and impurities.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.399
When these impurities
enter the bloodstream,

00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:30.480
they can cause fever.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.479
In severe cases,
it can make the mind dizzy,

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:33.399
and consciousness scatter.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.479
I hope you will take good care
of your wife from now on.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.600
General,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.479
Xiao Ye and Su Man'er said
it's late at night

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:57.679
and insisted on going back to sleep.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.960
Have them

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.719
kneel in the ancestral hall to pray.

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.920
Alright.

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:10.079
Before Madam's fever subsides,
they must not get up.

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:11.840
Understood.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.000
Hua.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.359
Yun.

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:37.280
You came.

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:39.760
Hua.

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:41.760
I'm sorry.

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:44.560
I'm late.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.760
I thought you wouldn't come.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.920
Yun.

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:06.079
Did you recognize me?

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.360
I'm so afraid you'll recognize me,

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:14.479
and afraid you won't recognize me.

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.960
But the heart is as firm as gold.

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:24.719
We will meet in heaven and on earth.

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.039
But the two of us

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.680
will meet in hell.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.360
As long as I'm with you,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.159
in life or death,

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.400
what does it matter?

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.599
Yun.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.680
Don't leave.

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.439
Don't leave me alone.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.159
Hua.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.759
You're sick.

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:33.080
I can't do this.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.759
I'm fully aware.

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:40.840
Sleep well first.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.879
Tomorrow,

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.319
when you feel better,

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.879
if you still make the same choice,

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.280
I won't push you away.

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:52.120
Okay?

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:12.199
Hua.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.519
I don't know why

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.800
you don't want to acknowledge me.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.160
But I know

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.920
you must have your reasons.

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:26.959
Whatever you do,

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.519
I will not leave you.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.959
As for those who hurt you,

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.279
I will make them pay.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.720
Xiao Yun is just the son of a concubine,

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:53.399
yet he climbed over you?

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.720
Kneeling in the ancestral hall,

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:58.839
even Grand Madam never made you kneel.

00:04:59.079 --> 00:04:59.839
Exactly.

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:02.040
How dare the son of a concubine do this?

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.839
Where are you from?

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.040
Do you know my godfather
is the King of Xiling?

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:17.720
I am a low-ranking official,

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:19.360
I don't know the King of Xiling.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.079
All I know is,

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.439
if you refuses to kneel properly here,

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.560
once you leave this gate,

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:28.120
life or death is uncertain.

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:52.720
Such a mighty general's presence.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.319
You made us

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:55.720
kneel for 40 hours.

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:59.279
If you have an issue with us,

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:00.639
you could just say it.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.519
Why torture us like this?

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:07.160
This is the leftover spice residue

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:08.720
from Grand Madam Xiao's room.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.000
Do you two

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:11.319
have any objections?

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:16.079
Actually, this isn't poison.

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:17.720
It's called "Snow on the Branch".

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:19.279
Rare to see normally,

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:21.639
used in wilderness areas
to repel mosquitoes.

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:22.720
Mosquitoes die instantly

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.279
and fills the whole room,

00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:25.439
hence the name.

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:29.040
A small amount is harmless to humans.

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:30.439
But too much

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.720
can cause dizziness,

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.720
or even fainting.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.920
Recently, someone has been

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.240
seeking this spice in Jiangzhou City.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.319
General has found out
the spice shop owner.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.879
Just identify

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.920
who has been buying it.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.639
You don't trust us,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.560
and want to re-investigate this matter,

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:57.279
I can understand that.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.759
But the two of us

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.120
just want to seek justice for Mother,

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.839
not to deliberately frame Qing Yan.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.879
If you don't trust us,

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:15.120
you can have someone investigate.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.240
The two of us

00:07:18.079 --> 00:07:20.079
act properly and uprightly.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.920
Really?

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.079
Sir, please take a good look

00:07:35.519 --> 00:07:36.800
who exactly

00:07:37.079 --> 00:07:39.759
was willing to pay a high price
for "Snow on the Branch" at your shop?

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:47.720
It seems...

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:48.839
It was her.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.759
It's definitely her.

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:51.360
She came to buy the spices.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.959
Are you sure?

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.160
Yes, she has a wound on her forehead.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.439
I don't clearly remember
the style of her clothes,

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.639
but roughly this color.

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:03.680
This outfit was clearly given to me by
the Second Madam yesterday.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.839
Don't speak recklessly.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.639
When have I ever given you clothes?

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.560
Besides, the spice shop owner also said

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.879
the person who bought the spices
yesterday had a wound on the forehead.

00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:16.079
Clothes can be faked,

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.120
but could the wound on the face

00:08:18.519 --> 00:08:19.759
also be faked?

00:08:22.519 --> 00:08:24.759
Don't claim things you didn't do.

00:08:28.079 --> 00:08:28.879
Yun Juan.

00:08:29.839 --> 00:08:31.959
Grand Madam usually
cares for you the most.

00:08:32.639 --> 00:08:34.559
I can't believe you would
do such a thing.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:35.919
Tell me,

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.639
who instructed

00:08:37.639 --> 00:08:39.320
you to buy such poisonous spices?

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.600
You are now working under Qing Yan,

00:08:44.639 --> 00:08:46.200
was it she who told you to buy it?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:47.960
If it really was her,

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:48.960
it's not your fault,

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.360
I will protect you.

00:08:50.519 --> 00:08:51.600
Don't lead her on!

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:57.879
It was her.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:01.919
Definitely her

00:09:02.639 --> 00:09:04.279
who instructed me to purchase
"Snow on the Branch"

00:09:04.559 --> 00:09:05.759
to frame the First Madam.

00:09:07.519 --> 00:09:08.919
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:09:10.679 --> 00:09:11.399
Ye.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.200
You must speak up for me.

00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:14.000
Enough!

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.679
You two women are too noisy.

00:09:17.879 --> 00:09:18.639
And you too.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.480
I warn you.

00:09:20.759 --> 00:09:22.440
My uncle is Minister of Revenue.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.600
My godfather is the King of Xiling.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.039
You better recall clearly

00:09:27.399 --> 00:09:28.879
who bought the spices in your shop.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.639
If you deceive,

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.600
it will be a serious crime.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.440
This isn't too hard to figure out.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.240
I heard that although
"Snow on the Branch" is poisonous,

00:09:41.639 --> 00:09:42.840
its price is high,

00:09:43.039 --> 00:09:44.360
because the fragrance lingers,

00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:46.200
so it's excellent
for killing mosquitoes.

00:09:46.399 --> 00:09:47.399
Is that true?

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.159
Madam, your insight
is remarkable indeed.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.279
Then it's easy to distinguish.

00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:53.879
Catch a few insects

00:09:54.159 --> 00:09:56.480
and see whose hand they die in,

00:09:56.639 --> 00:10:00.080
then we'll know who caused
Grand Madam to fall.

00:10:38.759 --> 00:10:40.399
You really have a clever plan.

00:10:40.759 --> 00:10:42.519
I think the doctor in this tile house

00:10:42.639 --> 00:10:43.559
need not spouting

00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:45.679
some tired cliches.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.080
Just tell

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.559
the story of how you poisoned
mother and killed sister-in-law.

00:10:49.639 --> 00:10:51.279
It wasn't me!

00:10:51.639 --> 00:10:52.360
Not you?

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.639
If not you, then was it your wife?

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.159
I see her hands

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.960
are perfectly clean.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.679
So it was you.

00:11:05.159 --> 00:11:06.600
You poisoned my mother!

00:11:07.559 --> 00:11:09.159
Rushing to abuse private punishment,

00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:12.000
are you afraid you won't live
until tomorrow

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.879
or that Su Man'er
won't live until tomorrow?

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.200
Mother gave you the steward's authority,

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.840
Su Man'er must be unhappy about that.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.759
I interact with her every day,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.039
so my hands naturally have
traces of "Snow on the Branch"

00:11:26.399 --> 00:11:27.519
which is inevitable.

00:11:27.519 --> 00:11:28.879
But her hands have none.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.279
She has a guilty conscience

00:11:31.559 --> 00:11:33.360
and washed her hands thoroughly.

00:11:34.279 --> 00:11:35.639
Cui Liang also said

00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:38.200
this spice is rarely found
in wealthy families.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.990
Xiao family has had official ranks
for generations,

00:11:40.519 --> 00:11:41.840
how could we have such a thing?

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:43.840
But Su Man'er is different,

00:11:44.679 --> 00:11:46.519
a rude woman from a merchant family

00:11:47.159 --> 00:11:49.240
naturally has such despicable means.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:51.960
Xiao Ye.

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:55.120
Su Man'er is at least your lawful wife.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.279
Betrothed as a wife,

00:11:57.159 --> 00:11:58.279
or taken as a concubine.

00:11:59.039 --> 00:12:02.279
I and Su Man'er never
had the three letters and six rites,

00:12:02.399 --> 00:12:04.039
so what kind of lawful wife is she?

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.399
At most, she's just a concubine.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:13.759
Ye.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.799
What are you saying?

00:12:17.559 --> 00:12:18.399
I'm saying you

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.000
are rude and despicable,

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:22.159
just a concubine at most.

00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:23.600
Do you understand?

00:12:24.399 --> 00:12:26.039
Do you want me to say it again for you?

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.120
You and I are

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.639
two grasshoppers on the same rope.

00:12:31.759 --> 00:12:33.960
If you say I poisoned Grand Madam,

00:12:35.039 --> 00:12:36.000
then I will say

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.080
that back then...

00:12:41.799 --> 00:12:42.840
I naturally remember.

00:12:43.399 --> 00:12:44.159
You

00:12:44.519 --> 00:12:45.440
being lowly

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.399
with a heart like a viper,

00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:49.279
dragged her out and sold her.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.399
I don't want to see her for a moment!

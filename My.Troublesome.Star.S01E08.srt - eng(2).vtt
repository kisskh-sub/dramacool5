H-How did they...

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.450
The reporters who left are coming back.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.440
Let's get out. Now.

Ms. Im Se Ra! Ms. Im Se Ra!

You're Im Se Ra, right?

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.790
Why did you hide the fact that you were Im Se Ra?

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.710
Bong Cheong Ja is your real name, right?

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.150
Ms. Im, look over here!

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.360
Did you come back after the accident
due to financial reasons?

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.830
Please answer me.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.910
Bong Cheong Ja is Im Se Ra, correct?

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.260
You're Im Se Ra, aren't you?

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
Please don't take photos.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.530
Hold on.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.220
You can run, right?

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.740
- What?
- We'll run at a count to three.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.680
But the reporters are blocking. How...

Pardon?

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.370
- Why are we here?
- You never know.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.330
The reporters might come
to the student apartments.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.980
Get out.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.730
I'm not looking.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.110
Just one second.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.400
It's okay.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.870
A bachelor pad is all like that.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.030
One minute. Just one minute. Hold on.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.500
Shit.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.660

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.780
Come in.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.870
Have a seat over there.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.480
Would you like something to drink?

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.390
- Just water, please.
- Water?

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.150
Here.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.870
Thank you.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.750
What do we do now?

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.860
You look flustered.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.720
Have a seat and rest.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.730
Should I? Okay.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.850
Why are you sitting on the floor
and not on the sofa?

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.050
Well, I don't usually sit on the sofa.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.220
This is for leaning on. Like this.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:10.960
I see. You drink and watch TV sitting like that.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.040
How did you know?

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.670
That's usually what a bachelor does at home.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.370
Should we watch TV?

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.000
Okay.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.630
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.300
Hold on.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.390
Well...

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:00.350
let's not watch TV for a while. Okay?

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.010
Why not?

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.480
You never know. If you saw
the news on Im Se Ra, you'd...

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.660
Do you know how funny this situation is?

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.760
What do you mean?

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.390
After I first got into the accident,

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:29.040
I found it so strange that
people didn't recognize me.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.240
I felt like Alice, who was
just dropped in Wonderland.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.380
But...

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.280
But in just a few months, people
are recognizing me again.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.670
It feels so awkward.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.120
You'll get used to it soon.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.900
- What I'm worried about is-
- I know.

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.050
People's reaction.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.510
I'm expecting it.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.870
The people who are looking
forward to seeing Im Se Ra

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:15.940
must find how I look now so disappointing.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:25.600
Im Se Ra's true side is even more disappointing.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.770
You probably don't know,
but I was so mean and selfish.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.450
What Go Hui Yeong said...

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.290
That was exactly Im Se Ra.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:47.090
You're in this mess
because you did it to yourself.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:50.350
You did it to yourself, I said.

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.410
She must've resented me so much.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.560
It's been 25 years,

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.780
but she still has ill feelings toward me.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.640
You never know.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.450
Someone else might feel that way, too.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:13.330
Someone who's hurt by my bullying and arrogance

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.160
and still resents me.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.700
The person who tried to kill me...

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:27.000
- Perhaps that's why?
- No.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.590
Im Se Ra I know wasn't like that at all.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.300
How do you know?

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.450
You never met me back then.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.530
I always face heinous criminals
and crazy bastards everywhere.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:45.200
I just know by looking into people's eyes.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:51.270
Someone might've been hit
by a stone you threw carelessly, but

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:54.200
you don't do that on purpose.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.030
Back then and now,

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.370
you've been the same to me.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.610
Are you saying that...

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.810
I'm still as unlikable?

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.710
What?

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.420
Unlikeable? When did I say that?

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.600
You said it when we drank with Tae Suk.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.330
That you really didn't like Im Se Ra.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.660
I didn't say it like that.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.790
I just said I wasn't such a fan then.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:39.200
That's the same thing. What's the difference?

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.700
You kept putting down that youngest detective, so-

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:48.320
What does it matter to you
if I put him down or praise him?

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.150
Of course, it matters. It-

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.310
The thing is...

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:58.850
Yes.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.010
You're right.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:07.090
Well, I felt offended as another detective.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:09.600
I felt kind of responsible.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.390
Or I felt a strong connection.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.600
Something like that.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.580
Where's your shower?

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.910
Pardon?

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:32.150
W-Why would you suddenly shower?

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.290
My hands. I want to wash them.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.780
Over there. You could've just said bathroom.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:47.800
Bathroom or shower. You wash
your hands there anyway.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.450
You don't wash your hands only in the bathroom.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.340
I brought you comfortable clothes.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.450
I'll put them in the front.

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:29.490
Come in.

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:32.890
Come inside.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:34.340
Sleep here.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.730
How about you?

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:41.040
I can just sleep on the sofa or the floor.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.560
I'll let you rest.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:13.080
The people who are looking
forward to seeing Im Se Ra

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.520
must find how I look now

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:19.970
so disappointing.

Why am I so excited? Huh?

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:57.440
Wake up, Dokgo Cheol. Wake up.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.480
Wake up, okay?

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.370
Shit.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:13.760
Hold on. I'll call you later.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.530
Shit.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.490
Geez.

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.840
Geez...

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.000
What are you doing?

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.560
Did she see it?

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.120
I don't think she did.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.490
Shit.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:56.930
Well...

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.920
Excuse me. You must've been startled.

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:09.540
Would you like a beer if you're awake?

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:14.460
Is she sleeping?

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.030
She's sleeping.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.690
Why does she snore so loudly?

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.660
How dare he try to tempt me?

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:03.160
The next news is about Im Se Ra.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.770
A lot of fans must've been curious about her.

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:09.030
She finally is back.

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:14.040
But her unexpected appearance
shocked us once again.

The phone is turned off.
You'll be connected to the voicemail.

What's so great about that industry?

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:29.230
Why go back and be treated like that?

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:37.450
Hey, you're home.

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:39.650
Was that why?

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:40.650
What do you mean?

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:44.080
You were against me becoming a celebrity.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.060
Was that because of Aunt?

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.060
It's all in the past. Why bring that up?

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.230
Why did you hide that she was Im Se Ra?

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:53.800
What if you knew?

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.880
Is it something to brag about?

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.580
She was a famous celebrity back then. So what?

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.450
You know how she is now.

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:03.040
Why do you hate her so much?

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.370
Whatever wrong she's done,

00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:07.790
others point fingers at her.

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.430
Why should her family join in, too?

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:13.270
Da Hui, I have my reasons, too.

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:14.860
But still.

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:17.380
Shouldn't family embrace each other?

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.480
I don't know what your and Aunt's story is,

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.090
but I'm different than her.

00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:25.080
What are you talking about?

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.750
Da Hui!

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:52.090
I think it's done.

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:54.250
Come out and eat!

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.220
Is she sleeping?

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.310
Time to eat.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.910
Come out and eat.

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:19.660
Let's eat.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:30.590
What are you looking at? Let me see.

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:32.410
Give it to me.

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:33.970
Come on.

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:38.320
[Her shabby appearance]

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:42.380
Geez. I told you not to look at this stuff.

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:46.890
I just wanted to see the articles
about our drama finale.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:49.400
You think the algorithm would allow that?

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.100
If you search, "Love Is Not a Crime,"
you'll get Bong Cheong Ja is Im Se Ra.

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:56.510
I was disappointed when they didn't recognize me.

00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:03.190
But it's very sad that
they recognize me like this.

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:07.160
Come out and eat. Hurry.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.660
I have no appetite at all.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:19.810
Let's go.

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.540
How dare you plug Im Se Ra in?

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:36.380
I let you sign on Im Se Ra, but...

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.530
casting her in my project is a different story.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:42.430
How's that different?

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:45.050
Hey, don't you know me?

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:47.510
I know you won't scatter petals on my path,

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:50.780
but I won't stand you scattering pepper flakes.

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.220
How did you find out faster than reporters?

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.960
Did you plant a mole around me?

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.840
I won't repeat myself.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.830
Remove her immediately.

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:03.740
I think you're confused.

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.160
It's my project, not yours.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:10.370
- What?
- It's officially produced by Two One Ent.

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:12.890
It's my first project.

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:16.030
But why do you tell me to add firewood or not

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:20.180
even before I start the fire? Why?

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:26.790
You aren't the only one
who's tolerating. I am, too.

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:30.100
And if you were going to leak it to the reporters,

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.500
try to do it at the right time.
[Bong Cheong Ja was Im Se Ra]

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.260
I'm fanning the flame to get it going,

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.180
but you splash cold water on it?

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.250
What are you talking about?

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:43.100
You're the one who tipped them off.

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:52.370
How much longer do I have to clean up your shit?

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:54.200
Hey, Kang Du Won. You-

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:58.320
How come you haven't changed at all in 25 years?

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.530
You bastard.

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.850
See, see?

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:05.230
Even if we're like a screwed up family,

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:08.470
do stay in your lane, okay?

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:17.240
Hello, I'm Dokgo Cheol, Bong Cheong Ja's manager.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.230
I'm in your care.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.480
- I'm in your care.
- Nice to meet you.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.500
I'm Dokgo Cheol. I'm in your care.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:29.230
You crazy bastard!

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.560
I'll kill you!

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:39.400
Hey! Hey!

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:47.150
What's with you?

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:49.940
CEO Kang wanted to see me.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.760
Hey, come in.

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:58.710
Let's talk together.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.140
The male lead is Won Ban.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:11.550
The female lead is Go Hui Yeong,
the goddess of Cannes.

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:14.050
The female supporting role, Im Sun,
will be played by Bong Cheong Ja.

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:15.900
- Pardon?
- No.

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:18.450
I should call her Im Se Ra, right?

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:20.830
Pardon?

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:22.400
[Miscasting]

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:28.400
It looks like the second-largest role,
after the lead.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.090
So, prepare for it.

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:31.940
Let Ms. Im know, too.

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.110
Let's do an audition, then.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:36.930
What?

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:38.860
Think about it.

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:43.570
It's the first major project
produced by Two One Ent.

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:46.670
You don't want to just give her
a big role and be done with it.

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:50.350
I guess they don't agree yet.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.150
Im Se Ra's public audition.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:57.060
That would get attention.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:58.800
I'd like to join the judging panel, too.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:02.490
Instead, if all judges agree unanimously-

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:03.930
Okay. I'll accept it, then.

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:05.790
Okay, then.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:11.490
I'll get going now.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:12.840
Okay. Bye.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.400
See you.

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:17.810
Get out.

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.970
Wow! Really?

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:24.340
For real? My gosh! Wow!

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:25.940
Are you that happy?

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:28.040
I'm not just happy.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.940
Lightning struck in a clear sky.

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:34.680
But a double rainbow suddenly appeared. My gosh.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.050
It hasn't been confirmed yet.

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:38.100
You need to have an audition, too.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:39.830
I'll make sure to do this.

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:42.750
I'll win the part, no matter what.

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:46.580
I couldn't work with Director Choi
because of the accident.

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:50.100
I'll make sure to make it happen this time.

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:53.580
I'll help you, whatever the outcome might be.

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:56.710
Drive me home first, then.

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:59.370
What? You'll go to the student apartments now?

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:01.220
I need to prepare for the audition.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:04.240
Hurry, hurry. I'll get changed.

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.900
It was a mess until this morning.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:26.760
Some crappy media company came
and took photos of this crumbling place.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.260
He tried to interview anyone he could.

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:30.940
You all must've suffered because of me.

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:33.450
I know you all aren't happy with me already.

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:36.850
What if Manager Kwon tells me to move out?

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.780
Should we go in?

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:56.920
What's wrong with you?

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.330
Gosh.

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.030
I'm so sorry.

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.760
I heard everything. I put you in a tough position.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.580
Why didn't you tell us you were Im Se Ra?

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:12.850
I guess I didn't get a chance?

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:21.480
I mean, are you that angry?

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.340
I wasn't emotionally ready.

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:31.020
You touched me.

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:37.180
I never thought I'd see
Im Se Ra in my entire life.

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:40.070
My favorite drama is "Jewelry Shop Girl."

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:41.920
I've watched it over and over again.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.090
I watched the whole thing 22 times. No.

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:47.880
Was it 24 times? That's how much I love it.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:51.550
Are you really Im Se Ra?

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:56.070
You changed too drastically.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.990
They found out what I did to that woman.

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:05.900
What did you do?

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.970
They found out everything I was told to do.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.510
What did they tell you to do?

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.420
What you told me to do.

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:21.580
We just want to save you
from the unfortunate situation.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:26.200
We aren't here to be framed for what you did.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.060
What? Are you trying to blame me for everything?

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:31.400
Stay in your lane.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.280
- Who did it?
- It was Ju Seung-

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.360
I see. This is how it will be?

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.600
Okay. I can't die like this.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:44.420
Go and tell them that I'll expose
everything if they act like this.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:45.980
I have nothing to lose.

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:48.300
What is it? Will you confess or something?

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.980
Why can't I?

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.710
I'm done for, anyway.

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:55.000
It'd be less lonely if we went down together, no?

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:02.740
Geez! I missed.

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:07.900
Hey, the election is just around the corner.

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:11.600
We're screwed if something goes wrong now.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.370
You want me to get lost without

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:18.010
gaining anything after spending a fortune?

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:20.170
You won't even flinch...

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.740
Hello?

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:27.950
Oh, my.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:30.300
Yes, i-it's me, sir.

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.230
Right now?

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:33.950
I'll be right there. Yes.

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:36.560
Yes, yes. Right away.

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:46.140
I swear you won't have to worry.

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:52.010
You're the one who should worry, not me.

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:53.390
Pardon?

00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:00.550
Make sure to get rid of her before the election.

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:05.640
Yes, sir. I'll make sure
to catch her and get rid of her.

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:10.860
Remove yourself from the campaign
committee until this is settled.

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:13.860
Pardon? W-Well, that's...

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:17.800
If you take action yourself and
something goes wrong,

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:21.100
you'll be a ticking time bomb to our campaign.

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:25.220
And you'd still show that face of yours?

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.540
I like that about you.

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:44.890
You're quick to understand your place.

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:51.690
That's why we've been
working together all this time.

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:07.310
That ball-less bastard.

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:09.360
That ball-less bastard!

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.120
That son of a bitch!

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:15.260
That damn son of a bitch!

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:19.660
Jeong Do, let's just get rid of her!

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:21.590
The police are already after us.

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:23.310
They even have conclusive evidence.

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:25.300
What? W-What did you say?

00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:07.350
Are you crazy?

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:12.300
- Continue.
- Continue what?

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:15.070
Does it make you mad to get slapped?

00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:17.710
Are you pissed right now?

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:21.200
Think about what you did to me.

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:26.300
You destroyed my dream and ruined my life!

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:37.740
Seeing how nice you look,

00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:40.660
I guess you must be living a good life.

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:44.440
After putting me into this gutter?

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:51.150
Yes. It must be just a fond memory for you guys.

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:56.010
You must've totally forgotten about me.

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.280
I'm sure...

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:07.670
I'm sure you wished me dead.

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:17.900
How does it make you feel
to see me back alive and well?

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:26.650
I've never slept soundly even for a night.

00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:29.640
I endured every day
while feeling excruciating pain.

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:31.940
I hung in there desperately!

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:35.010
For this very moment!

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:40.750
What do you want me to do?

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:54.920
It won't be fun if it ends too easily.

00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:04.030
I hope you look forward to it.

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:08.750
My revenge starts now.

00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:57.420
How did you feel to reunite
with Im Se Ra after 25 years?

00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:00.390
To be honest, I was surprised.

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:05.760
I didn't think she'd remember the
scene from 25 years ago.

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:08.220
The film from 25 years ago.

00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:12.100
What if Im Se Ra had played the role
instead of Go Hui Yeong?

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:15.870
I felt it then, but Im Se Ra is
really a natural actor.

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:18.100
No, she improved even more.

00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:25.100
It's been so long to feel excited
about working with a true actor.

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:44.600
It's not even a big role. Are you that happy?

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:48.270
Someone recognized my work
and approached me.

00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:49.960
I'll make sure to do this.

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:53.280
I'll win the part, no matter what.

00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:32.190
I think I totally messed up the audition today.

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:41.400
You did well.

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:43.400
You did very well.

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:50.890
Really?

00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:53.300
Was I really okay?

00:48:56.690 --> 00:49:00.410
That was the best acting I've ever seen.

00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:02.460
I guarantee you.

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:05.150
No one could've done as well as you.

00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:10.590
I was worried.

00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:13.780
What a relief.

00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:17.550
It's thanks to you.

00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:24.610
Thank you for watching me.

00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:30.450
You mean it, right?

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:41.270
The article about Im Se Ra's
failed audition isn't necessary.

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:46.920
He wants to do things as quietly as possible.

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:51.050
So, just get rid of her quietly?

00:49:53.730 --> 00:49:57.530
And the one you sent last time was so stiff.

00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:59.920
I didn't like how cocky she was.

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:01.980
Find me someone else.

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:06.420
What's with your eyes?

00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:07.460
What about my eyes?

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:09.760
Why are you staring so intensely?

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.050
Is something bothering you?

00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:12.720
I mean,

00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:17.290
I feel uneasy wondering how much
longer I need to do this stuff.

00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:21.010
"This stuff"?

00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:23.560
Im Se Ra and the other kids...

00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:26.490
They're Two One Entertainment's assets.

00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:33.660
Gosh, my neck hurts.

00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:35.960
Did you think they were yours?

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:37.630
Whose are they, then?

00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:39.920
I fed you when you were desperate.

00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.040
Now, you think you're a human.

00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:44.590
You're just a dog.

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:56.800
Wasn't 25 years enough to settle things?

00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:58.540
Who's doing the calculation?

00:50:58.540 --> 00:50:59.760
What do you mean?

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:01.080
Think about it.

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:03.900
You're just a slave, yet you're talking
about ending the contract.

00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:06.350
That makes no sense.

00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:09.420
A slavery contract lasts forever.

00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:10.470
Slave?

00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:14.120
You want to undo the shackles and run away now?

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.560
Go ahead and try it, you bastard.

00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:18.370
You won't even travel 10 ri.

00:51:18.370 --> 00:51:22.080
You'll be crippled before you're halfway through.

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:32.900
Whether I'll be crippled or be freed...

00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:35.200
I'll know when I get there.

00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:39.290
Shit!

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:45.850
You brought in Im Se Ra to do this, didn't you?

00:51:45.850 --> 00:51:50.810
You told the press that Im Se Ra was back.

00:51:50.810 --> 00:51:54.870
That's an amazing scenario. Yes.

00:52:08.310 --> 00:52:10.210
You'll break this.

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:17.150
Don't you dare stare at me like that, you bastard!

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.280
Shit...

00:52:34.310 --> 00:52:36.940
Hey, release the article now.

00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:50.080
Once you start the drama,

00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:52.800
shouldn't you get a place and move out?

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:56.300
I thought about doing that,
but I still feel comfortable here.

00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:58.700
It's not like I have a family.

00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:02.200
I was worried that you might be moving out.

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:03.600
What a relief.

00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:07.400
I didn't even do much for you.
I thought it didn't matter if I stayed or not.

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:10.850
You're the only one I talk to.

00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:17.190
No one else is willing to talk to me like this.

00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:18.500
When is your exam again?

00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:22.200
I won't count the days anymore.
I won't worry about it in advance.

00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:24.190
When I count and as the day approaches,

00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:26.950
it's hard to focus because I feel so stressed.

00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:29.490
You're right. Don't be so stressed.

00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:32.850
You're young and have a whole future ahead of you.

00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:38.140
Today's failure is only
an experience for the future.

00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:42.770
You'll learn once you reach my age.

00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:48.390
How bright and wonderful your age is.

00:53:51.830 --> 00:53:53.800
Why are your hands so cold?

00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:57.300
I keep the heater off because
I don't want to get sleepy.

00:53:57.300 --> 00:54:00.230
Give me your hands. Let me warm them up for you.

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:04.920
Are they warm?

00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:12.390
Give me a break.

00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:25.620
That little...

00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:39.420
Yes, it's me.

00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:46.020
So, what happened to me?

00:54:49.410 --> 00:54:51.770
[Im Se Ra, making a comeback as the lead
of a new drama after 25 years]

00:54:55.770 --> 00:54:57.214

[Im Se Ra, making a comeback as the lead
of a new drama after 25 years]

00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:07.760
Gosh, stop!

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:10.440
Stop fiddling with me.

00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:35.650
I need to lose weight first.

00:55:35.650 --> 00:55:37.410
All of a sudden?

00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:43.700
I've never ever felt gluttony before.

00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:47.280
But I don't know how much I've let go
of myself in the last 25 years.

00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:49.130
I get hungry when I turn around.

00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:52.150
Whenever I see food, I go crazy.

00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:55.860
I can't manage my weight.

00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:59.580
I don't think you need to be thin
for this role, though.

00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:01.440
I don't need to be plump, either.

00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:06.050
I should make it up to the fans
who have been waiting for me.

00:56:06.050 --> 00:56:11.590
But I don't think you could do
that overnight. The fat-

No, I mean...

00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:16.500
So, will you get a personal trainer or something?

00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:19.390
I can't afford to do that.

00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:35.530
Are you okay?

00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:37.080
Should we rest?

00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:40.300
Here.

00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:49.060
Okay, okay. Yes, yes.

00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:51.170
More, more, more, more.

00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:53.160
Okay. Four reps.

00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:57.670
Yes. More, more, more.

00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:03.020
- More, more, more.
- I can do it!

00:57:03.850 --> 00:57:06.210
You're working out, right?

00:57:06.210 --> 00:57:07.640
Why am I tired?

00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:09.580
This is hard, too.

00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:12.090
Stop!

00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:17.570

- Here.

Thank you.

00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:25.830
Gosh, I feel better now.

00:57:25.830 --> 00:57:27.990
What happened to the culprit?

00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:30.560
Why do you ask?

00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:34.390
You told me that you found conclusive evidence.

00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:36.630
Is he still not talking?

00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:39.900
It's not a situation for him to talk.

00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:41.910
What situation?

00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:48.420
Well, the thing is, we need further investigation.

00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:55.700
You know how they do face-to-face
interrogations in movies?

00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:59.270
- He might talk if I met him-
- No, no. There's no need.

00:57:59.270 --> 00:58:02.220
Just focus on your job as you are now.

00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:04.890
Keep working out at a crowded
place like this, okay?

00:58:04.890 --> 00:58:06.130
Okay.

00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:09.300
Try not to go anywhere without CCTVs.

00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:12.370
I'll try to be with you, but you never know.

00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:14.570
Don't worry.

- Please keep an eye on him.
- Okay.

00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:38.350
Is he not improving at all?

00:58:38.350 --> 00:58:40.800
I'm worried that he'd never wake up.

00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:45.480
Instead, someone coming to finish
him off would be a bigger issue.

00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:46.770
Pardon?

00:58:48.570 --> 00:58:50.140
Nothing.

00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:51.810
Anyway, he's in your care.

People wake up miraculously in a few months on TV.

Carry on.

00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:58.180

- Unni.
- Yes?

How are you losing weight?
Your face looks so thin.

00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:05.360
Really? Can you tell?

00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:06.770
Yes.

00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:29.640
How come it's so hard to lose this?
What did I eat?

00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:32.610
It's the fat you gained from aging.

00:59:32.610 --> 00:59:36.000
Go ahead and keep trying.
You'll only lose muscles.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.540
You'll end up having osteoporosis.

00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:41.100
You're in a worse shape than I am.

00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:44.040
Why should a building manager be in shape?

00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:47.060
I just need to manage the building well.

00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:51.900
You're in a drama, thanks to her.
But you're being so rude.

00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:55.030
Should I curl this mouth, too?
This mouth of yours?

00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:56.670
- Seriously.
- Ouch!

00:59:56.670 --> 00:59:59.240
Please get it together and
do a good job this time.

00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:01.350
I'm good. People just don't know it.

01:00:01.350 --> 01:00:03.400
You're bad if people don't know it.

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.820
- That's why you get fired.
- You think they understand art?

01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:08.060
Art, my foot. You make art on your own.

01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:10.900
You should work hard if you're
getting paid. Am I wrong?

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:13.880
- That's why there's no advancement in art.
- Advancement in art, my foot.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.870
Do it right this time. Stop going on about art.

It's Bong Cheong Ja, not Im Se Ra.

The great Go Hui Yeong is scared
of little old Bong Cheong Ja?

Not the pudgy ahjumma, Bong Cheong Ja.

They want to see the queen of Cannes,
Go Hui Yeong. You.

Necklace?

- I see.

Well, how should I say?

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:05.400
She's not too flashy, but she keeps
grabbing your attention. And...

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:08.820
she has a subtle aura. And...

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.450
Shinichiro.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.560
Time to get up.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.500
Time to wake up.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.830
Oh.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.380
You're awake.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.310
Good morning.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.150
Good morning.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.070
This looks delicious.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.250
Right?

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:11.810
Thanks.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.860
Mm-hm.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.840
It was my turn to make breakfast today.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:21.750
I'm sorry.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.980
It's okay. I was up early anyway.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.980
Let's eat.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.060
Miki's wedding...

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.440
is coming up soon.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.040
I need to get my suit dry-cleaned.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.810
I don't have a suit, so I need to buy one.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.080
Let's go buy one together today.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.530
Huh?

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.910
I'll get off work early.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.000
Today is a no-overtime day
for you too, right, Shinichiro?

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.660
Yeah.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.360
Then let's go together.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.480
Okay.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.080
I think I'll have another one.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.800
There's still rice left, right?

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.450
Yeah, this is the last of it.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.450
What about for the bento?

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:05.620
Huh?

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.460
The rice for the bento.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.090
I always pack it fresh in the morning.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.440
So...

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:13.550
This...

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.740
I shouldn't, right?

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.220
Sorry.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.410
No, it's fine.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.280
It's my fault for oversleeping.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.220
I'm sorry.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.210
Looks like no bento today.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.540
- Then let's just eat the side dishes I prepared.
- You can eat more?

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.840
Speaking of which...

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.240
This little guy doesn't look so good, does he?

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.490
I think it's on its last legs.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.500
Oh, I see.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.880
I thought this little guy would stay healthy forever.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.000
It makes me a little sad.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.790
Yeah.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.400
"Stay By My Side After the Rain"

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.700
(Episode 12)

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.960
I really want a motorcycle, but I'm broke.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.760
Can't they pay us more?

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.450
Takahashi, you're always complaining.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.140
Mashiro, isn't there anything you want?

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.750
As long as I have them, I'm happy.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.460
Them?

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.820
Ah...

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.340
Showing off now that you've got a girlfriend.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.580
I just wish things could stay like this forever.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.470
Listen up, Mashiro.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.890
Things never stay the same.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.350
Huh?

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.040
Staying the same is the hardest part.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.500
Don't get complacent just because things
are going well with your girlfriend.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.930
Or you'll pay for it later.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.660
Actually, my partner isn't a girl.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.970
What?

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.490
So you told your parents too.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.400
Yes.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.740
I hadn't planned on telling them.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.020
It just sort of happened.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.800
Do you feel better now that you've told them?

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.970
Yeah. What about you, Aizawa-san?
Did you make up with Niijima-san?

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.750
Yes.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.520
We talked things over afterward.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.950
We were able to share how we truly felt with each other.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.090
So everything's fine now.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.060
I see.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.360
So that means...

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.520
Kanade-kun and Sumire-chan...

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.350
are both happy now.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.020
Yes.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.520
Hmm...

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:35.670
Oh?

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.260
Is something else bothering you?

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.750
No... It's just that because I'm so happy...

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.760
it actually makes me a little anxious.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.660
Huh?

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.590
Shinichiro.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.250
You're early.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.140
Have you been waiting long?

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.500
No, I just got here.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.380
Oh, these are Kanamori-san and Aizawa-san.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.890
Hello.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.070
I'm Mashiro. I'm dating Kanade.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:01.340
Oh.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:03.340
H-Hello.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.030
We've been wanting to properly introduce ourselves
to you, Kanamori-san and Aizawa-san.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.230
I see.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.200
I'm Kanamori-san.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.010
I'm Aizawa-san. It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.220
It's a pleasure to meet you both as well.

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.620
Well, we'll be going now.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.560
When you feel happy,

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.840
you should just let yourself be happy.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.460
Don't be so negative.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.500
Thank you.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:35.870
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:36.740
Good work today.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.830
You too.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.680
Good work.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.690
I'm so glad you were here, Kosuke.
You were a huge help.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.220
I never could have chosen by myself.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.680
I'm glad we found something that suits you.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.950
Oh, thank you.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.390
The alterations will be ready next Saturday, right?

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:56.010
Yeah.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:57.800
I'll go with you.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.840
Let's grab a bite to eat on the way back.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:01.360
Sounds good.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:08.790
What's wrong?

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.790
Kosuke, do you ever feel... insecure?

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:16.820
Insecure?

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:19.770
You see,

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.210
I've been so happy lately.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.920
Eating together every day,

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.300
talking about nothing in particular.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.130
On our days off,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.580
we go out together.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.690
We fight sometimes,

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:36.310
but all of it...

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.130
it's all so important to me.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:40.870
Me too.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.090
But...

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.440
the happier I am,

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.650
the more a part of me feels insecure.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.330
I wonder how long things can stay like this.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.700
Ten years from now,

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.000
or twenty years from now,

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.430
what will we be like?

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.010
We can't get married like Miki and the others.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:18.140
Things can't stay the same forever.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.980
Why the sudden trip to visit your dad's grave?

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:32.770
It's been a while.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.950
And I wanted to see you, Mom, and thank you.

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:38.160
Thank me?

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.510
I got some money from Grandma.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:45.230
Oh.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:47.500
Thanks.

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:49.800
Well...

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.900
I was just giving you back your own money, Kosuke.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.700
I wish I could go be with him soon.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.360
Jeez.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:22.740
There you go again.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.680
You think I'm being a bother, don't you?

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.040
You wouldn't understand, Kosuke.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:50.040
You're right. I probably didn't understand before.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.100
But I think I get it a little now.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.150
Someone you thought would always be by your side...

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.900
if they were suddenly gone one day,

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.410
I think I would definitely...

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.510
feel the same way you do, Mom.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:29.770
So, I don't think you're a bother at all.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.210
What did you say to your dad, Kosuke?

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.750
You were praying for a long time.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:43.250
Oh.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.750
I prayed that everything goes well.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.710
For us,

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:49.880
for you, Mom,

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:50.850
for Grandma,

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.770
and for everyone.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.530
What a silly thing to say.

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:57.590
Life isn't that easy.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:59.680
Well, it doesn't hurt to pray.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:05.430
And I promised him...
that I'd bring Shinichiro to meet him someday.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:08.750
Because I want him to properly meet my dad.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.880
Shinichiro is a very important person to you, isn't he?

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:15.140
Yeah.

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:19.250
You should cherish the time you have together.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:21.530
Huh?

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.360
You never know what might happen,

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:29.990
so being together now is all the more important.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:33.850
Yeah.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:36.370
Thanks, Mom.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:44.840
Well, back to the grind tomorrow.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:48.120
My muscles are still sore.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.500
Good work.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:58.590
Did you get it?

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:04.290
Someone from Dad's company sent a lot,
so I'm sharing some with you.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:06.310
Oh, I see.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.510
Thank you.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:12.520
Dad said he wanted to send them to Shinichiro,
so he packed the box himself.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.090
But this is a lot.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.560
Dad...

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.420
He said that two people should be able to finish it.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.560
What on earth does Dad mean by that?

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.770
Don't overthink it.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.990
I'm sure Dad doesn't know what to do either.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.070
Yeah.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.230
And tell dad thank you for me.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:39.040
Well, then...

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.530
Thanks for coming with me.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:32.780
It's nothing.

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:34.490
I'm the one who insisted on coming.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:37.450
- Ah, where are you going?
- Huh?

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.770
Didn't we say we'd find a nice restaurant
on the way back?

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:42.490
Oh, right.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:44.860
I...

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:46.710
have a place I want to go.

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:48.200
Hmm?

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.130
This place really is the most comforting.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.990
And the owner knows all about us.

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:00.640
Well...

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:03.140
It is comforting, I guess.

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:04.720
Hmm?

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:08.000
Are you sure you want to come here?

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.670
Ahem!

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:13.550
No...

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:15.620
That's not what I meant.

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:19.240
Is the length of your suit okay?

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:20.750
Huh?

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.480
You should probably try it on.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.560
It happens all the time, you get the pants hemmed
and then realize they're too short.

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:27.960
Well...

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.150
I'll try it on when I get home.

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.250
Try it on now.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:33.430
Huh?

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:34.250
Now?

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:35.480
Here?

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.500
Excuse me.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.560
Can we use the room in the back?

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:41.800
Sure.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.550
There are no other customers anyway, so it's fine.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:45.770
I'll take a look for you.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.240
So? How is it?

00:14:58.880 --> 00:14:59.560
Huh?

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:26.240
Ta-da!

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:29.860
Huh? What's going on?

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:34.930
I thought we could have our wedding right here.

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:36.680
A wedding?

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.050
Sorry to surprise you.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:41.550
A while ago,

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:45.010
you said you were feeling anxious, Shinichiro,
so I gave it some thought.

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:49.190
Of course, this isn't an official ceremony.

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:52.170
But we can promise to stay by each other's side forever.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:54.500
We can make a special vow
that's just between the two of us.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.550
I also asked the owner to help out.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:06.580
Alright then...

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.060
Please recite the wedding vows.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.530
Huh? Wait...

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.900
Kanade Shinichiro,

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:18.490
do you take the man before you,

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:20.530
Mashiro Kosuke,

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.860
in health

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:23.780
and in sickness,

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.630
till death do you part,

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:34.030
to love him for the rest of your life?

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.020
I do.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:46.290
I do, too.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.000
Congratulations.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.160
Well... I'll go get things ready.

00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.890
Like you said, Shinichiro,

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.250
no one knows what the future holds.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:04.270
Ten years from now,

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.430
or twenty years from now,

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:08.350
something might change.

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:10.900
But...

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:12.700
if we have no idea what's going to happen,

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:14.690
then imagining a wonderful future

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:15.500
is a much better bet, isn't it?

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:17.320
A better bet?

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:21.450
Like someone inventing a curry that you can
eat as much as you want of without gaining weight.

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:25.060
Oh, or maybe a future where humans don't have to work anymore.

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:28.490
And...

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:30.840
we can get married.

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:35.360
You're so optimistic, Kosuke.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.020
Give me your hand.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:05.710
This is...

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.940
in place of a wedding ring.

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.480
I thought it would be nice for us
to wear something matching.

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:16.560
The money I sent to my mom before...

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.620
She told me to use it however I wanted,

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:19.900
so she gave it back to me.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.520
So,

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:23.830
I bought the thing I wanted most right now.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.280
Shinichiro?

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.320
For me...

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:35.820
you prepared all of this.

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:39.370
I'm sorry.

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.500
I was always thinking about the future

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:44.860
and feeling so anxious.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:48.780
You know, the future...

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:51.370
is just built from countless present moments, isn't it?

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:52.790
So,

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.950
as long as we try to make the present better,

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.830
that should be enough, right?

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.630
Shinichiro, all your anxieties,

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.110
as long as you're with me,

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.530
I'm sure we can cut them in half.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.620
So...

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:09.780
Let's be together forever.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:14.420
Yeah.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.420
Thank you.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:18.250
Oh.

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:21.020
Shinichiro, you put mine on too.

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:22.620
Okay.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:51.360
And now...

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.490
You may now kiss.

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:57.550
Okay.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.170
Here it is!

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.670
The special wedding cake.

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.170
It's amazing!

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:41.390
Thank you.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:42.990
Thank you.

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.790
But can the two of us finish all this?

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:47.610
Huh?

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:50.150
Probably...

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.380
not.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:54.980
Congratulations!

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.150
Cheers!

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:04.290
Everyone, thank you for coming
on such short notice.

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:04.900
Of course.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.500
Kanade-san and Mashiro-san, you both look so handsome.

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:10.250
You seem to be truly basking in happiness.

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:11.040
Yes.

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.660
I'm all right now.

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:15.580
Someday, Sumire-chan and I will...

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:18.550
You'll come to our wedding then, right?

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:19.810
Of course.

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.000
Oh, stop it. It's too soon for that.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.310
I'm serious.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:24.920
Kanade-san.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:29.090
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. I'm glad you could make it.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.200
I just told Takahashi about us the other day.

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.810
He's very happy for us.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.880
I was surprised when I first heard.

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:39.660
But Mashiro looks so happy.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.210
He hasn't stopped gushing about you to me.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:42.720
Huh?

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:43.540
I have?

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:44.480
What do you mean, "I have?"

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:52.420
Oh!

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:55.090
It's a tower of mackerel sandwiches, on the house.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.450
- On the house?
- It looks delicious.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.130
Put it right in.

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:00.760
Just as it is.

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.950
Excuse me.

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:07.700
We have a private party today.

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:09.310
Oh, I see.

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:22.520
What a lovely atmosphere.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:25.870
Let's eat, everyone.

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.180
Please come again.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.460
We will.

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:30.640
It'll be on me.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.850
If I could see my past self,
I'd want to tell him...

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.040
that if you keep living in the moment,

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.450
a wonderful future will be waiting for you.

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:56.900
Before I knew it,

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:59.970
I was surrounded by so many people
I could be open with.

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:03.480
I'm no longer alone in my world.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.470
From now on,

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.320
no matter what happens,

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:10.820
no matter the circumstances,

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.910
Kosuke will be by my side.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.670
As I continue to build a life with Kosuke,
moment by moment,

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.230
I wonder what the future holds for us.

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:26.620
I can't wait to find out.

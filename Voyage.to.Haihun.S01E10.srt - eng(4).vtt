=Episode 10=

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.980
Wang.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.070
You've been wronged.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.590
Thank you, Qingge.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.140
Give me a hand.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.360
- Right.
- Exactly.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.480
I just heard the market
in Jiyang is bustling.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.950
Would you both care
to join me for a stroll?

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.000
- No.
- No.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.120
Still angry?

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.960
- No.
- Not at all.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.680
Bottling up anger is never good.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.240
I've got a way for you two
to get all that anger out.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.800
Humph.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.400
Go for it!

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.240
Nice peck! Keep at it!

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.000
Peck it!

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.280
Peck it!

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.860
Peck it!

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.710
Harder!

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:34.750
It flew away!

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.940
- Why?
- A bet's a bet.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.280
The one who lost should make
the first move to reconcile.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.360
No need.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.080
Then I'll just go check on my chicken.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.550
What's wrong with Qi?

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.250
He's just shut himself off.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.680
- Qi.
- Qi.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.840
That's the emblem
of Senior De Jiu's sect.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.560
Today, I'll avenge Master.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.320
De Jiu.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:57.490
Retreat!

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.470
Senior.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.750
- Thanks.
- No need.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.310
Are you all alright?

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.320
Lady De Jiu.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.030
Can you take me along
for such things next time?

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.290
Then we would've got hurt.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.260
Your old injury has flared up.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.150
About that offer to handle your meals,

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:26.540
why not consider it?

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.120
I'll take Lady De Jiu
for treatment first.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.080
You two have a talk.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.970
Go on, quickly now.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:33.850
Let's go.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.630
What's there to talk about?

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:40.870
Who'd even want to talk to you?

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.920
(In Biography of the Five Sons
of Emperor Wu, Book of Han,)

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.670
(the Duke wants to find
the long-crowing rooster in Jiyang)

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.130
(and buys bamboo staffs on the way.)

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.230
(On his journey to the capital
to ascend the throne,)

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.910
(Liu He bought two bamboo staffs.)

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.960
(Others thought he was just frivolous,)

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.180
(but in truth, he was simply thinking
of his grandfather.)

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.090
That year,

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.490
Grandfather stood upon Mount Tai

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.600
at the Fengshan Ceremony.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.760
Clad in the dragon robe,

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.640
he looked like a deity,
with enormous power,

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.010
and the realm bowed before him.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.720
Your grandfather was truly remarkable.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.480
Do you wish to be
an Emperor like he was?

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.240
I'm just not cut out to be an Emperor.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.110
Well.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.810
At least you're aware
of your own limits.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.000
Is the Mandate of Heaven

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.190
true?

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.240
Indeed.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.310
So, my men from Changyi

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.220
will all die?

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:44.270
Yes.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.850
What about me?

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.590
You were Emperor for 27 days.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.320
In the end,

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.480
Huo Guang dethroned you.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.040
Why such a big reaction?

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.270
If I'd known,
I wouldn't have said anything.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.520
Let me ask you this.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.510
Who is Huo Guang?

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.390
Huo Guang is...

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.270
What's his title again?

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:18.720
Grand

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.060
General.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.070
And me?

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:21.950
You'll be the Emperor.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:22.830
Who outranks whom?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.840
You don't believe me?

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:28.880
I believe you.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:30.540
But I don't believe in fate.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:32.210
If worst comes to worst,

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.750
let's change our fate.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.000
It could've been changed.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.580
But you ruined it.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:43.990
Heng,

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.590
was your fate ever foretold

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:47.590
in the Mandate of Heaven?

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:53.710
No.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.640
You're the uncertain fate
I've been waiting for.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:02.230
After all,

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:04.150
you're an Immortal.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.860
(Huo Mansion)

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.800
Milord,

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.790
Duke of Changyi, Liu He,
used the Dingtao exam as a pretext

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:58.000
to cut down on redundant staff.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:59.790
This was suggested

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:01.360
by a remarkable strategist,

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:02.390
Wang Heng.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.000
I've never heard of him.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.540
What's so remarkable about that?

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.030
The equine administration in Changyi

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.270
and the exam in Dingtao

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.550
were all his doing.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.750
His origins are shrouded in mystery.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.390
No ancestry, no roots to trace.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.280
Nor any father or mother to claim.

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:21.350
On the night the Bronze Qilin appeared,

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:22.920
he suddenly emerged in Changyi.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:27.730
I have

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.280
one more matter to report.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.640
The heroine who evaded capture before

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.650
is now among the Duke of Changyi's team.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:37.760
Regarding this heroine,

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:39.840
do not alert her needlessly.

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:41.220
Simply keep a discreet watch.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:43.840
- Leave me.
- Yes.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.000
Go on.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.240
Hey.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:47.360
Wait.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.910
As for Wang Heng,

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.670
with no record or ties,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.670
he may well be of use.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.560
Yes.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:12.620
(Jiyang)

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:13.740
(Hongnong Lodge, Hongnong)

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:21.140
(Hongnong)

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.020
Duke.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.320
Isn't it inappropriate for Lady De Jiu

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:25.760
to travel with us to Chang'an?

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:27.960
She is my senior.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.550
Besides, she is injured.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.450
How could I possibly abandon her?

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.080
But...

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.120
We've arrived in Hongnong.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.710
Rest here and recover.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:40.880
If you wish to buy goods,
feel free to do so.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.300
Sir, have mercy on the child.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.440
Sir, grant him a bite to eat.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.300
Sir.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.860
Please, have pity.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.580
(Lodge)

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:06.540
Qi.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.320
- Duke.
- Lord Gong.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:10.550
Lord Gong.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:18.630
Everything here is ready.

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:19.470
Duke.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.860
Does this place
have any unique game dishes?

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.600
I just found the most distinctive game
to be had here.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.010
Shh, go and make the arrangements.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.450
Alright, let's go.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:31.890
- Qingge, look.
- Yeah.

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:33.010
Let me go!

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:33.960
Help me!

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:34.990
Let me go!

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:36.750
- Help!
- Stop!

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:37.600
Let me go!

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.900
- You brazen knave!
- Let me go!

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.420
Harassing women in public.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.810
Stop running!

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:48.710
Come back here!

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:49.920
Hurry, move!

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.110
The situation is too complicated.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.510
This place is not peaceful.
Saving them is enough.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.080
Don't act rashly.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:00.500
Thanks for stepping in to help.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:01.590
If it weren't for you,

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:03.560
we might not have made it out alive.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:04.660
It's okay.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.790
These days,
my fate has been a cruel one.

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:08.000
If you don't mind,

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.000
can you take us along?

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:10.750
We can handle
all the hard and dirty work.

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:12.180
We won't trouble you in the least.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.720
Why not let them come with us?

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:14.580
No.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:18.510
Ladies,

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:20.060
we still have a long way to go.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.910
Take this money instead.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.260
It should keep you fed
and cared for a while.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.240
They are in such pitiful straits.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.320
Why not let them come?

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.510
Anywhere will do,

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:35.440
just not Hongnong.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.720
Do we still have the roster
from the last exam?

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.750
Everyone saw it today.

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:48.630
The people of Hongnong
are living in great hardship.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.120
The Duke wishes to do
some good deeds here.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:53.200
It's best if they're done

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:54.950
by a good person.

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:57.650
So among us all,

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.840
is there anyone named Shan?

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:02.290
Is your name Shan?

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.330
Is your name Shan?

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:08.790
A courtesy name, nickname,
or alias is fine.

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:11.720
Is your name Shan?

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:15.710
So,

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:17.240
being called Shan

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:18.590
means you're a good person?

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:21.480
The locals don't know who we are.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.020
If the messenger's name

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.030
has "Shan" in it,

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.540
won't that leave a fine impression?

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:28.230
It makes sense.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:30.350
Anyone?

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.910
If you do a good deed,

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.840
the Duke will award you handsomely.

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:47.720
Heng.

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:49.550
You're acting rather strange today.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.150
First, you stepped in to stop me

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.240
from helping them,

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.550
and now you're seeking someone
I've never heard of.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.910
Because both of these matters
mean a great deal to you.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:00.200
How so?

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.600
If I were to say

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.550
these two matters

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.600
could alter your fate,

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.000
would you believe me?

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.680
I would.

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.840
The Mandate of Heaven says
that when you pass through Hongnong,

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.820
you'll have Shan drive the ladies
in a covered cart,

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:18.150
which will tarnish your reputation,

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:20.120
leaving you in a tough position

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:21.720
in Chang'an later.

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:24.080
So, you mean to say

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.360
the women we met on the way here

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.440
are those mentioned
in the Mandate of Heaven?

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:31.710
I fear that may be the case.

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:35.200
So, if we can track down Shan,

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.910
we might prevent the prophecy
from unfolding.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.450
That way, we won't be
on the back foot in Chang'an.

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:41.510
Exactly.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.070
This is also my chance to see

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.200
whether the Mandate of Heaven
can be altered.

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.170
When I have you,

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.510
it's like my grandfather's
great-grandfather

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.800
had Zhang Liang.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.240
You could just call him Emperor Gaozu.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.670
- What?
- I'm leaving.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.150
Hey, where are you going?

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:00.270
We're short on time.

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:02.580
I'll get De Jiu and Qingge
to split up and search.

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:04.000
Perhaps Shan

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:05.600
is right here in the city.

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:06.800
Well.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:07.720
What about me?

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:09.470
You?

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.030
As the origin of the Mandate of Heaven,

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.120
you're very important.

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.030
Just stay put.

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:23.600
Lord Wang.

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:26.320
There's no one named Shan in this area.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:29.270
Try searching further west.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:30.600
Many thanks, sir.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.630
I shall take my leave.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.200
Are you Mr. Wang Heng?

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:38.720
You're looking for me?

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:40.990
Someone named Shan

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.150
wishes to meet you.

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:44.000
But he can't show himself.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.330
Here's the address.

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.860

=Voyage to Haihun, Season 1=

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.220
=Episode 6=

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:31.790
Insolent commoner.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.310
This is Chang'an Envoy's turf.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.260
(Huo)

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.120
I have urgent matters to report.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.950
- Inform them at once.
- Yes.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.760
I'll take only six men to Chang'an.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.870
Isn't six men too few?

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:45.790
Too many cause trouble.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.430
They must be the finest.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.040
I will act with utmost caution

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.240
and bid my time.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.590
First, I plan to send men

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.870
to Chang'an to gauge the situation.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:54.840
Once we are certain

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.620
nothing can go wrong,

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.880
we'll proceed to Chang'an.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.310
Wang, no...

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.270
Duke.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.230
You truly carry the bearing of an emperor.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.280
I will personally decide the candidates.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.600
Very well.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.910
Lord Gong.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.990
We're exposed.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.360
Ah!

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:21.840
What are you doing?

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.080
You, come here.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.080
Got you.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.270
Uh?

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.840
We seize the rebels of Changyi by order.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.520
The equine administration

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.800
was in your full charge.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.240
You conspired with the Duke of Changyi.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.520
I truly have no idea.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.680
Speak.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.960
Where is the Duke?

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.400
Don't you understand me?

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.120
Execute.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.210
Still refusing to tell the truth?

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.750
I swear, I really don't know.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.200
Execute again.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.000
Deceiving the Empress Dowager...

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.030
Who could answer such a grave matter?

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.600
Foolish Liu He fled on his own.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.850
What's that got to do with us?

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:05.800
Continue the execution.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.640
Wait!

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.630
This was planned by me alone.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.630
I will bear the full responsibility.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.200
As for where the Duke has gone,

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.520
we truly have no knowledge.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.150
We acted only

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.740
out of desperation and fear.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.120
So we had to take this desperate step.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.560
Cut them all down!

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.800
I'll fight you to the end!

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.060
(June 11, 74 BC)

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.140
(June 10, 74 BC)

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.000
Wang?

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.310
Why is it you?

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.200
Giddy-up!

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.470
Where's the Duke?

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.310
Duke?

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.560
Where's Qi Chang?

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.080
He said he went to find you first.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:11.920
Is he out of his mind?

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.120
Let me in.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.000
Let me through.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.870
Don't push.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.320
This is bad.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.360
Make way.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.430
Step aside.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.670
- Don't push.
- Make some room.

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.410
- Step aside.
- Who's pushing?

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.030
Mr. Qi, hurry over!

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.330
Stop shoving, easy there.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.610
Clear the way.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.160
What's wrong with you?

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.130
You're bumping into me.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.300
Watch the road.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.010
Don't hit my face.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.000
I'm aiming right at you.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.110
You're Qi Chang?

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.970
You're Liu He, yes?

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.880
You think people are playthings, huh?

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:56.800
First,

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.780
you're Liu He. Why didn't you tell me sooner?

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.630
Second, you had me compete
in your place,

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:01.470
while you escaped.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.160
Aren't these enough for a beating?

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.520
Yes.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.440
I didn't tell you who I was.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:09.800
But have I not told you,

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.310
as long as you stay by my side,

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.430
we could journey to Chang'an.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:13.940
You don't believe me.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.080
Besides,

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.580
if I had revealed my true identity,

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.680
what if you betrayed me?

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.720
Betray you? Over what?

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.720
That's not a secret.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.120
The Duke would grant titles and rewards?

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.720
You'd sneak me into the horse race?

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.430
If you just ran off, what about me?

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.680
Calm down for a moment.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.240
I truly planned to run away with you.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:35.680
How about this,

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.920
we leave right now.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.950
Stand right there.

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.230
Hold your ground.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.590
Heng,

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.030
what are you doing?

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:48.410
To keep an eye on you.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.510
Don't think about leaving.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.710
Why not?

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.920
The first time we met,

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.270
what did you call me?

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:57.260
Immortal.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.680
I, the Immortal, will tell you,

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.270
the imperial decree will arrive today.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.530
You can head to Chang'an openly.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:05.670
What do you mean?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.840
You…

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.040
will become the Emperor.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:16.390
Me?

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.560
Exactly.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.590
You.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.600
Once you're Emperor and in Chang'an,

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.720
surely you can reclaim the Qilin.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.230
I've heard Duke of Guangling

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.770
(Advisor Wang Bingji;
Minister Liu De)

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.120
gave much money to Huo Guang.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.920
In the end, it might all be for nothing.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.620
See, you don't know this part.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.640
His wife accepted the money.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.000
When he got back,
he scolded her fiercely.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.360
If you accept this gift,

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.560
it could all become

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.850
a disaster that costs your life.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.910
Up ahead is Changyi.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.190
What a lively place.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.190
Great!

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.510
Qi.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.480
Stop acting.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.270
I already know everything.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.270
You must've let it slip.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.390
I'll deal with you.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.430
The imperial decree has arrived!

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.620
(June, 74 BC;
Fourth Month, Yuanping Year 1)

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:30.680
(Ban Gu)

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.920
(recorded in Biography
of Huo Guang, Book of Han,)

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.650
(that Emperor Zhao of Han
passed away early,)

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.760
(leaving no heir.)

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:40.810
(Minister Chang and others discussed,)

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:41.860
(upon the Book of Rites,)

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.560
(one who inherits becomes his son.)

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.750
Liu He, receive the decree.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.270
(Duke of Changyi inherits the throne.)

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.600
(Minister of Imperial Clan, Grand Herald,)

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.120
(Imperial Advisor, Imperial Envoy summons
the Duke of Changyi to handle the funeral.)

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.950
Liu He, Duke of Changyi,

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:02.070
- (grandson of Emperor Wu of Han and Lady Li)
- An imperial edict is issued:

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.290
- (once little noticed by others,)
- The acting Grand Herald Yuecheng,

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.010
- (now,)
- Minister Liu De,

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.490
- (due to the support of Great General)
- Advisor Wang,

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.380
- (Huo Guang)
- Imperial Guard Commander Li Han,

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.820
- (will rise to the throne.)
- will escort you to Chang'an.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.020
(It truly took everyone by surprise.)

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.760
(Even Liu He himself didn't expect)

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.860
Liu He, receive the decree.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:22.900
(that his fate)

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:27.750
(had changed dramatically
in just a heartbeat.)

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:40.460
(Huo Mansion)

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.340
(Duke of Zhou Assists Young King Cheng)

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:54.320
Great General.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:57.410
Duke of Changyi should already be on his way.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.590
(Minister of Agriculture Tian Yannian)
The imperial edict just arrived.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.120
The Duke will set out tomorrow.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.080
Just arrived?

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.990
Matters of state must not be delayed.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.200
Please be at ease.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:09.870
I will hasten his departure at once.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.510
And what of the Bronze Qilin?

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:13.750
Reporting, my lord,

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.270
it has been completed.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.080
Those who once hunted the Qilin's trail

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:21.120
have all been dealt with

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.200
according to your will.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:23.670
So no troubles remain.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.170
With the Duke losing the Qilin,

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:27.670
he will stand weak and alone.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.120
When the time comes, the realm

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.670
will be yours alone to command.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:35.450
Insolence!

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.200
Qilin's blessing is just an illusion.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.630
It's merely a rumor from the streets.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.360
Retrieve it only to guard

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.600
against traitors with ill intent.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:51.320
Yes.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.320
Report to the Duke.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.580
(Duke of Guangling's Mansion)

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.260
A message about Changyi.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.440
It's urgent, please decide at once, Duke.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.820
(Duke of Guangling, Liu Xu)

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:31.600
The assassination attempt failed,

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.510
and the decree from Chang'an arrived.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.670
Useless lot.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.460
(Qingge Tavern)

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.600
First, you beat up
the future Emperor of Han.

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:52.700
And now you've shut him out at the door.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.700
By law, I could sentence you to death.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.240
I know you're still upset.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.240
Can't I at least offer an apology?

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.630
I come from a powerful family.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.510
Most people befriended me for power.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.120
The books say
there are three kinds of true friends:

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.870
Honest,

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:29.080
understanding,

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:30.780
and knowledgeable.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:33.030
But I hadn't met any kind.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:35.360
Not until I met you.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:36.690
I met all three at once.

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.030
I feared that
once you learned my identity,

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:44.720
you wouldn't treat me with sincerity.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.360
And I'd lose my most treasured friend.

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:53.390
Heng,

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:56.790
I've brought you a gift.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:59.840
Whether I was Qi Chang before,

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.430
or Liu He now,

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:05.750
I will journey with you to Chang'an.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.600
I'll come for you tomorrow.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.270
I'll leave this gift here.

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:12.600
Tomorrow, I'll tell you its meaning.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.030
Then I'll be on my way.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.590
What are you doing?

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:38.920
Why bring me here?

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:39.780
Don't move.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:40.910
- Qingge.
- Stay still.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:41.750
Qing...

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.490
Who covered my eyes?

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:44.800
What are you doing?

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.030
You madman, let go.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.270
Are you out of your mind?

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.920
- Don't move.
- Let me go!

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.200
- Alright.
- Liu He!

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.270
Everyone, get away.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.200
Going to war requires a sacrifice.

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:56.870
And you, an insolent commoner,

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.120
relying on a bit of talent,

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.440
you struck me.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.010
- Don't move.
- And struck me twice.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.110
- Lunatic.
- This...

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:04.790
is what becomes of you.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:06.670
You took advantage of me
and cast me aside.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.350
Fatuous ruler, let me go right now.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.750
- Insulting me?
- Hurling insults.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.150
Such behavior must be punished.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.080
I am the Qilin Immortal.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.080
If you sacrifice me,

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.770
are you not afraid
of divine retribution?

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:16.800
Not at all.

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:17.980
Sacrificing you will only help

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.670
your soul returns to the heavens soon.

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:21.710
You can report to our lord,

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.050
so that the Great Han may flourish.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.270
Xu Qingge!

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.000
Are you siding with them in this mess?

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.180
I think...

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:29.280
the Duke has a point.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:30.570
We should burn him at once.

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:31.980
I want to go home.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.620
Untie me, come on.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.180
You're really setting it on fire?

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.080
Help me!

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.990
Shh.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.080
Let me go!

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:38.970
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.150
Come on, over here.

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:41.510
Release me.

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:42.970
- Help!
- Look at him.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:52.750
Heng.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:54.610
I prepared this Bonfire Banquet for you.

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:56.100
Surprised?

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.130
Not expecting this, right?

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.600
Are you all out of your minds?

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:15.820
Today is special.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.080
I can go to Chang'an.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.790
That's the first joy.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.440
Qingge took first place,

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.270
first horsemanship in Changyi.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:25.750
That's the second joy.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.010
Heng survived the ordeal.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.050
That's the third joy.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:33.630
As the saying goes,

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.480
triple blessings arrive.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.750
Shall we drink to our heart's content

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.990
and keep drinking till dawn?

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.330
Drink!

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:44.480
Just to round things off.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.690
You don't have to stage a raid.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:46.590
Hey,

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:47.840
yes, we have to.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:51.150
Without the depth of great sorrow,

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.320
how could joy strike so suddenly?

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.560
Wang.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.180
The Duke is in a playful mood.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.150
Don't take it to heart.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:05.430
Wang.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:08.200
Drink, drink, drink.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.120
For your sake,

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:13.750
I'll let it go.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.280
Then...

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.960
Once we drain this cup,
we are fellow travelers.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.850
Fellow traveler.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.370
Cheers.

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:37.800
Drink.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.710
I'm not drunk.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:39.870
Can't sleep, huh?

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.080
You either.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:42.920
Alas.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:45.370
Come with me.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.200
Uh.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:48.960
Where are we going?

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:50.320
Horseback riding.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:51.970
That's riding after drinking.

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.320
Riding after drinking.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:56.350
That's when it's fun.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:10.960
What are you staring at?

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:13.670
The view here in Changyi

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:14.990
is quite unique.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.440
Unique?

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:21.390
It's just so-so.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:22.600
You should be content.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:25.390
The whole of Changyi is your home.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:26.960
Eh,

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.080
what about your home?

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.080
How is it?

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:31.320
My home?

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.030
It's nothing special.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:39.550
The home of an Immortal…

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.990
Isn't that basically a fairyland?

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.160
Come on, tell me.

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:45.480
My house

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.480
is several times taller than

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.550
the tallest building here.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.160
When night falls,

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:53.130
the whole city is lit up like day.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.490
So bright that you can't see stars.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:58.000
Carriages don't need horses.

00:16:58.450 --> 00:16:59.390
They move on their own.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.320
We will go to Chang'an

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:02.960
by plane.

00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:05.510
It'd only take an hour.

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:07.400
In just one hour?

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.530
What's a plane?

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:10.480
It's a type of transport.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.110
It can carry people

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:13.240
and soar to the skies.

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:17.000
Sounds like a fairyland.

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.440
Then take me to see it.

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:21.680
Once we reach Chang'an

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.100
and I secure the Qilin,

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:24.830
only then can I return.

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:27.520
When that time comes,

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.070
I'll decide to take you along or not.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.880
If you go back on your own,

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:33.440
how am I supposed to make my wish?

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.300
You're already the Emperor.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.310
Is there any wish you can't fulfill?

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:41.350
Even as the Emperor,

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.960
I can't fulfill every wish.

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:45.480
What is it you wish for?

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:49.590
If it were possible,

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:51.590
I want to roam the land.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:54.640
With the sky as my curtain and earth as seat,

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:56.680
graceful melodies flow,

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.590
kindred spirits gather,

00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:59.680
wine in hand,

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:01.000
I'm free,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.310
unbound, and at ease.

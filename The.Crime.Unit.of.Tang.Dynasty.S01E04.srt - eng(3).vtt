00:00:52.083 --> 00:00:53.416
This ruined temple has been torn down.

00:00:53.458 --> 00:00:54.916
You still have the nerve to live?

00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:56.583
Go meet your Buddha.

00:00:57.541 --> 00:00:59.125
What are you doing? What are you doing?

00:00:59.208 --> 00:01:00.583
What are you two doing?

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:05.041
Well, a lowly slave and a bald donkey.

00:01:05.125 --> 00:01:06.333
You two even teamed up.

00:01:06.416 --> 00:01:07.541
Keep beating them for me.

00:01:20.458 --> 00:01:22.666
I'm exhausted—let's go.

00:01:38.583 --> 00:01:40.250
Miss, are you alright?

00:01:47.583 --> 00:01:50.000
Master Liu punished you again?

00:01:55.833 --> 00:01:56.833
Monk.

00:01:58.083 --> 00:01:59.375
In this world,

00:02:00.083 --> 00:02:02.416
is there truly no way for everyone to win?

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.083
Who are you, really?

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:30.166
Where is Liu Yiran’s body?

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.791
Willows sprout, whip the top

00:03:36.125 --> 00:03:39.208
Willows green, fly the kite

00:03:39.291 --> 00:03:42.958
Willows die, kick the shuttlecock

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.583
What were you just singing?

00:03:49.375 --> 00:03:53.541
Willows sprout, whip the top

00:03:53.583 --> 00:03:58.375
Willows green, fly the kite

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.541
Willows die, kick the shuttlecock

00:04:01.583 --> 00:04:02.791
My Yaor

00:04:03.375 --> 00:04:05.208
This is my Yaor

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.041
Heaven plays cruel tricks

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:13.041
Madam, our Yaor is alive

00:04:14.333 --> 00:04:16.000
Yaor, Yaor

00:04:16.083 --> 00:04:17.708
Are you really my Yaor?

00:04:28.083 --> 00:04:29.541
Let me ask you again

00:04:29.583 --> 00:04:32.958
Where is Liu Yiran’s body?

00:04:33.875 --> 00:04:34.833
Stop!

00:04:40.666 --> 00:04:41.541
Monk

00:04:42.208 --> 00:04:43.916
Was it you who killed Liu Qiaoqiao?

00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:47.375
Then why did you gouge out her eyes after killing her?

00:04:47.583 --> 00:04:49.666
Are you afraid her vengeful ghost will come for you?

00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:10.750
Monk

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.291
Do you like me?

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.375
Buddha’s teachings cannot save all

00:05:24.875 --> 00:05:27.208
You and I can only save ourselves

00:06:00.416 --> 00:06:01.791
Monk

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:13.958
Come on

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.541
Auntie

00:06:17.041 --> 00:06:18.333
Save me

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.083
Help me

00:06:20.125 --> 00:06:22.375
Scream your lungs out—no one will save you

00:06:22.875 --> 00:06:24.583
Come on, come on

00:06:30.916 --> 00:06:31.958
Sister

00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:35.750
Let me do it

00:06:38.041 --> 00:06:40.291
That would be best

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.708
Qiaoqiao, let's leave this place

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:47.791
We'll never come back

00:06:47.875 --> 00:06:48.708
Mm

00:07:08.791 --> 00:07:10.125
She's dead

00:07:16.166 --> 00:07:18.083
I saw it with my own eyes

00:07:21.583 --> 00:07:24.208
We thought we escaped the den of evil

00:07:24.833 --> 00:07:27.458
But we fell into another one

00:07:29.541 --> 00:07:30.750
But now

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.875
I don't want to run anymore

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.541
Monk

00:07:40.625 --> 00:07:43.000
You can use my corpse as bait

00:07:43.625 --> 00:07:45.291
To catch the killer

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.666
I haven't married yet

00:07:56.791 --> 00:07:58.583
When I die, I wish

00:07:59.916 --> 00:08:02.083
To wear a bridal gown

00:08:05.041 --> 00:08:06.041
Monk

00:08:08.083 --> 00:08:09.458
After I die

00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.250
Can you gouge out my eyes

00:08:14.375 --> 00:08:17.125
I don't want to see this world anymore

00:08:46.458 --> 00:08:47.541
So

00:08:47.791 --> 00:08:49.708
You used Liu Qiaoqiao's corpse

00:08:49.875 --> 00:08:52.083
To lure out the killer of Liu Yiran

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:54.833
I also used illusions

00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.375
To kill the corpse watcher at the depository

00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:03.583
Lin Xiaoran

00:09:03.625 --> 00:09:04.583
Tell me

00:09:04.916 --> 00:09:06.708
Should I just kill you with one stroke

00:09:06.916 --> 00:09:09.583
I think judging the case like this is too hasty

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.000
We should examine the body again

00:09:12.208 --> 00:09:14.041
So we don't miss any clues

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:27.458
Yaor, Yaor

00:09:28.041 --> 00:09:29.208
Sing it again

00:09:29.291 --> 00:09:31.625
Sing the nursery rhyme your mother taught you for father, will you?

00:09:32.541 --> 00:09:33.833
Not my mother

00:09:34.416 --> 00:09:36.000
I have no mother

00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:42.083
My sister Liu Yiran taught me

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:44.916
She knew it since she was little

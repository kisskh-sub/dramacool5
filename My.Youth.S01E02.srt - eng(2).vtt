00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.470
(Song Joong Ki)

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.170
(Chun Woo Hee)

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.610
(Lee Joo Myung)

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.610
(Seo Ji Hun)

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.990
(my youth)

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.890
(Episode 2)

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.270
What was that about?

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.740
Just saying I was happy to see you.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.410
Bye.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:16.980
Hey!

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.190
Were you always in such a rush?

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.330
If you're that happy, at least buy me a meal.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:36.870
And drinks.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.410
It's not like we're 19 anymore.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.990
You're saying I liked that flower?

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.060
- Yes. - I don't even know what that is.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.190
That's how I remember it, anyway.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.030
- If I liked it, I'd know the name. - Fleabane.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.400
No, that's not it.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.800
You recall every little thing from back then?

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.510
- What about you? - I recall what I want to forget.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.579
Oh, here it is. You don't remember this?

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.610
Right, this.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.819
I still don't remember.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.020
You were good at studying. Your memory should be...

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.260
Here you go.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.090
Thank you. Have a good day.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.050
Oh, hey. Did you just get out of school?

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.920
Have you been eating properly?

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.719
- Gosh, why are you so skinny? - I don't have money, so get lost.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.960
Hey, when have I ever come and shaken you down for money?

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.460
Wait a second. No, that's not what this is about.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.670
Can you watch this kid for me?

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.740
I swear I'll be right back for her. So just for a little while, please.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.740
You always say that, but you don't. Like I'd believe you.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.280
No, I'm serious this time.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.220
Nu Ri. Something urgent came up for me,

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.350
so I can't look after you. I'm so sorry.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.660
You dump a kid on me, on my life?

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.990
How old are you?

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:42.860
She's pretty, right?

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.960
Gosh.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.400
You were living a double life? The nerve.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.569
Hold on tight to him, okay?

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:51.599
Hey!

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.440
Is that how you talk to your father? Calling me "Hey?"

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.890
In just a few hours, the year 2008 will come to a close,

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.660
and 2009, the Year of the Ox, will begin.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.329
A big crowd is at Bosingak Pavilion for the traditional bell-ringing.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.230
Hae.

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.140
Can I call you that?

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.740
I guess you can. I am older than you, after all.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.610
What does this mean?

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.860
Nothing is normal.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.230
Do you even know how to read Korean?

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.470
That's a relief. You have no idea what it means.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.140
Why the sudden search for a big gig? Did you get into trouble again?

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.010
He left his girl's kid with me. And now, radio silence.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.479
The mother took off ages ago.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.649
So what? Are you going to raise her yourself?

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.550
Someone's got to raise her. She's just a kid.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:14.890
Hey, you're just a kid yourself.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.990
(Heavy snow)

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:02.860
Full points.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.209
I'll return my key.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.309
- All set. - Have a good one.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:19.410
Goodbye.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.720
- You're here, boss? - Don't call me that.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.090
What's with the book you're always reading?

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.120
I just feel like I should be reading something.

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:37.660
See you tomorrow, boss.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.200
Go straight home, you punk. No detours.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:42.700
I'd need the energy for that.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.979
- How did you find my house? - Is that important right now?

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:56.749
Take your anger out on my father. Why are you causing a scene here?

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.349
Have you forgotten all the people who got scammed because of you?

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.619
Enough. Let's go get tteokbokki. Come on!

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:03.620
Unbelievable.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.860
- Seriously. - We were on our way. It's okay.

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:08.760
You must've been starving.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:15.200
Making quite the first impression.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.800
This is where you live?

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:21.840
Do you live with your mom?

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.779
My mom and your dad are getting married. Sad, isn't it?

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.479
Sounds like you're the one who's sad.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.850
My mom is coming to see you. So you better act pathetic and beg.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:32.819
- Beg her to let you live with us. - And why would I do that?

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.390
- Because it'll drive my mom nuts. - And what good will that do?

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.260
You really must be sad.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:40.760
Kim Seok Joo.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.900
Why doesn't this bother you?

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.769
- It's making me mad. - Done making trouble? Get lost.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:54.970
It's not trouble, I'm just curious. Hey.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:56.910
Hey, I said let's talk.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.580
Darn...

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.820
Oh, Seok Joo, you're still here.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:16.120
Well, make yourself at home.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.390
I guess I'll just be in my room. Yes.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.260
We both know you're here, so why are you acting this way?

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:27.769
Are you doing this on purpose? I'm the guest,

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:29.929
so what am I supposed to do when you act more like a guest than I do?

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:31.040
You're making your guest feel unwelcome.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.570
So, what brings you home?

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:37.340
Home?

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.440
Your home... I mean, your sister's...

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.750
(Kim Seok Joo)

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:44.980
And you...

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.820
aren't you curious how your own kids are doing?

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.690
Am I allowed to be curious?

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.160
I wonder how Hae is doing.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.400
Do you still keep in touch?

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.040
Okay, I'm really leaving now.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.270
I wish you a long and healthy life.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.880
- Look at you, not one gray hair. - No, I dye it.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:19.479
Seok Joo. Is he a bad kid?

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.680
Or is he a good kid?

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:25.920
Welcome.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:41.410
A carton of cigarettes, please. That yellow one over there.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.340
This one?

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.520
You don't look much like Chan, do you?

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:56.389
I don't know where he is, and I don't have any money.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:57.560
He's at my place.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.159
We're getting remarried. And no introductions are needed.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.229
I see.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:06.230
You're a special student, I hear. You skip school but enter contests.

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:07.730
And you always win an award.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.170
I'm handling your school transfer.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.380
There's no way Chan has been a proper guardian to you,

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.150
so you need to at least graduate from a decent high school.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.320
I'll also provide tuition and rent within reason...

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.089
You're not very responsive when an adult is speaking, are you?

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.260
Things usually turn out the way adults say they will.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.490
Since I'm still legally a minor,

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.290
I just have to show up at the start of the new semester, right?

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.330
- Would you like a bag for that? - How nice and compliant.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.540
I wish my Seok Joo were more like this.

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.040
So, how much are you offering?

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.780
I'm curious what you've budgeted. That reasonable amount.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:05.519
I guess you can't stand me at home, so you'd rather just pay me off.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.660
Never mind. This kind of help just ends up as another debt.

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:10.290
You were held back a year, right?

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.260
You need to graduate from high school.

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:15.870
What do you see in a man like him?

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:20.970
He's innocent.

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:26.740
I have no intention of mooching off of you,

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:29.250
so don't worry and have a good life, you two.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.250
- Hey. - Hello.

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:35.750
Hello.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.529
- Hey! - Hello.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.559
- Have a good break? - Yes.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.600
All right, let's take attendance and get right to it.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.770
- Yes. - Let's see.

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:56.710
Sunwoo Hae.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:59.179
Time to wake up.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:02.609
- Okay? I'll take attendance again. - Okay.

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:03.880
Number one, Go Hyo Sun.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.149
- Here. - Look who's here.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.220
Hi there.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.390
How about we group these by threes?

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:10.919
- Okay, in the first row. - One.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.960
- One and zero. And one. - Zero. One.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:17.059
- That's right. - "Are you really leaving me?"

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:22.530
The greatest achievement is to blur the line between work and play.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:26.970
Here, "to blur the line between work and play" describes it.

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:29.169
Got it?

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.539
You'll study here until the list is made.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.939
If you skip, submit your academy forms.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.009
- Okay. - Okay.

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.510
- Class dismissed. Bye! - Goodbye.

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:49.489
He's just sleeping all day. Wake up.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:52.930
You've got your part-time job. Get up. Let's go.

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:57.939
Did you pick an academy yet?

00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.699
I told you not to act all friendly with me, didn't I?

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:00.700
But we are close.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:02.409
We've known each other for ten years.

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:03.410
No way.

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:05.340
Besides, I can't stand people like you.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.010
And what are "people like me?"

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:08.850
Well...

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:10.810
The ones who carry daggers in here.

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:18.819
Did you already know Sunwoo Hae?

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.659
You sound like you knew him. Were you a fan when he debuted?

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:24.400
A fan? Please. He was so incredibly annoying back then.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:27.900
So what is the deal between you two?

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:30.800
You're the one who told me not to act friendly.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.370
Gosh, I ought to...

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.250
I sent you my new number.

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:26.290
Oh, you got it activated.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:29.090
Ta-da.

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:30.830
Happy birthday!

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.230
Okay, make a wish and blow out the candles.

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.339
Hang on. Hold this for a second.

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:39.600
Oh, for crying out loud.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:49.449
Hey! You have to make a wish first. That was your sitcom role, right?

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:52.719
Granting other people's wishes. If you make a wish, it'll come true.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.750
You'll grant it yourself.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:55.620
I have to grant my own wish now?

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.920
Forget the wish, I'm just going to eat.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:01.630
Now that you're 20, I'll buy you drinks for life.

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:03.490
- Just give me the cash instead. - Not a chance.

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:08.430
(Late Autumn)

00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:12.370
- I'm home. - Oh, you're back?

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.910
Hey, what's with your clothes?

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.180
What? Welcome.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:21.079
- Hello. - Have a bite while you wait.

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:22.150
Wait for what?

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.419
I work the night shift part-time. Today, I'm just filling in.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.320
- Here you go. - Hey.

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:28.649
I'll go change. I'll be right out.

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:29.989
Hey, where do you think you're going?

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.990
What about the green onions?

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.990
The green onions? Right.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.530
I thought you just sent me out for some fresh air.

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:38.200
Hey, have you learned nothing about this business?

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.729
I have never served a single dish without green onions.

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:42.099
There must be some in the fridge. Go look.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.000
So you were on your way to get green onions.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.210
Oh, so nights might be difficult? I can just drop off the profile...

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:51.679
The owner apologises, but we're out of green onions right now.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.240
Oh, that's all right.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:54.449
Enjoy your meal.

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.210
I'd be grateful for your call. I know how busy you are.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:02.390
Oh, okay. Then maybe while she travels...

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.820
You're working hard.

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:07.659
Oh, are you all finished? One moment.

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:08.729
I'll ring you up.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.229
Oh, I see. Okay.

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:12.930
- Do you need the receipt? - Oh, I don't need it.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.629
- Thank you. Get home safe. - Thank you.

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:16.800
Come again.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.080
Je Yeon, can I see you for a second?

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.849
Je Yeon, can you give this to Hae?

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:39.590
There's a career form inside. Make sure you get it back from him.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.290
He's the only one left to turn it in. I'm counting on you.

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:45.000
Okay. Teacher?

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:50.029
I heard Hae's a year older than us. Did he just get back from abroad?

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:53.239
No, he didn't study abroad. Apparently, he took a year off.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.139
- He was sick for a while. - I see.

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.740
And you know the new turf out front?

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.080
Hae's family is the one funding it.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.220
(Sangdu-dong, Dongjak-gu, Seoul, 25-48, Unit 201)

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.460
They're installing the new turf?

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.479
"To be family-oriented."

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.110
"To run."

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:44.190
Hi! I'm the class president.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:47.820
I have your award and gift certificate.

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:51.560
You waited all this time for this?

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:57.900
I was afraid I'd miss you if I went to eat.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.000
Plus, I need the career form that's in there from you.

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:03.540
- Our homeroom teacher asked. - Who's that?

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.180
Shouldn't I say hello?

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.780
Hello. I'm the class president.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.280
I'm just here on an errand.

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:16.990
Hello.

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:20.660
I'm his little sister. I'm in daycare.

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:25.030
Want some ramyeon?

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:28.900
Ramyeon?

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.100
Thanks for the food.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:43.509
This is so good.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:44.620
I'm good at making it.

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:56.990
Just one little pebble fell out,

00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:59.130
but everything came pouring out.

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:31.060
I haven't read a novel in forever. Something that isn't for test prep.

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:33.159
- This is really good. - You think so?

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.400
I'm very picky.

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:38.370
Ever since I was a kid, I always found school books boring.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.240
I can lend it to you if you like it.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.950
- Really? - It's coming out as a book soon.

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:50.610
- A book? - Yes.

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:54.020
Wait, don't tell me you wrote this.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:57.220
I wanted books for my little sister, but didn't like the ones available.

00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:01.830
You say that like it's nothing, but it's incredible.

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:05.230
Are you, like, a genius or something?

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.870
I don't know about that. As long as it makes money, I'm good.

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:10.470
Money?

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:16.040
I'll be sure to buy the book when it comes out.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:20.910
And I'll pay you for the ramyeon, if you want.

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:26.880
So you're supposed to get this back?

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.320
Yes.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.190
How did they know I wouldn't go to school?

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:33.790
Why do you keep skipping school?

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.390
I'm either working or sleeping. Besides, there's no reason to go.

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:41.570
Future goal? George Clooney.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.529
What is this? Be serious.

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.670
I am being serious. It's just hard.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.610
This is supposed to be the easiest thing to do.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.880
Fine, then start with the section for your parents' hopes.

00:22:56.610 --> 00:23:00.080
(Parents' Hopes)

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:02.819
What did you write, Ms. President?

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:06.760
Judge, prosecutor, and lawyer. I just wrote what my mom told me to.

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:08.290
Aren't you supposed to write down your own dream?

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:10.159
Your mom isn't you.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.930
Gosh. Let's see what you come up with.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.970
Goodness.

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:17.900
Sorry.

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:21.200
We're not that close yet.

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:23.670
I got heated.

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:27.780
Well...

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.650
I'm just going to write down "Rich." Because that's what I want to be.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.420
Think you can fill all three slots?

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:37.990
Sure. Rich, super-rich, and tycoon.

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.100
So...

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.740
You have a part-time job or something?

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.270
Yes. Pretty much whenever I'm awake.

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:57.410
Do you mind if I ask why?

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:00.910
To make ends meet, I guess?

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.580
What do you do with your time, Ms. President?

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.850
Besides sleeping, I'm pretty much always studying.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:10.020
Gosh, that's fascinating. Isn't that exhausting?

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:11.450
Is it?

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:13.490
I'm not sure.

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:19.929
You know, I thought you were going to put down "actor."

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:21.260
Where did that come from?

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:25.240
For the career form. You were so famous as a kid.

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:29.110
Did you retire or something?

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:34.950
- George Clooney is an actor. - Oh, I had no idea.

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:37.150
I don't really get to watch TV.

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:41.620
No wonder. That seemed like a weird job title.

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:46.120
- So that's a person. - You don't go online much, do you?

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:48.860
Haven't you heard them talk about me?

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:50.930
No.

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:54.030
I'm not really interested in gossip.

00:24:55.970 --> 00:25:00.470
How about sleeping at school? You could go to the nurse's office.

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:03.509
- Or come in late or leave early. - What's your point?

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:04.880
I'm worried about you.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.540
What if you miss too many days and can't graduate?

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:09.980
Gosh.

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:13.520
It's been a long time since anyone besides Geon No worried about me.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:19.090
Who's Geon No? He must be much older than you.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.400
- The bill, please. - Just a moment.

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:33.000
- Did you enjoy everything? - Yes, we did.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.440
Let's see, 1 soju and 1 beer.

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:38.279
Yes, that'll be 4.7 dollars. Ouch!

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.280
Gosh.

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:44.379
- Would you like your receipt? - No, I'm good.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.150
All right, thank you. Ouch!

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:48.320
Are you okay?

00:25:48.321 --> 00:25:49.449
Yes, I'm fine.

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:50.719
Thank you. Come again.

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.260
- Okay. - Thanks, it was great.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:57.029
- Have a good night. - Hae, does this have to stay here?

00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:58.229
I keep getting pricked by it.

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:00.559
It looks good there. Besides, we put that there ages ago.

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:01.670
And you're still getting pricked?

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:08.470
Here's the dish you didn't order.

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:11.470
But I didn't order this. Why bring it?

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.210
This is what happens when you only order drinks.

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:18.820
A flower shop by day and a bar by night?

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:22.119
I've helped out here since I was 20. The owner's a guy from my hometown.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.120
Since you were 20?

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:28.120
Oh, right. You were 20 when we were high school seniors, weren't you?

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:32.329
- Was it because you were ill? - Did I tell you that much?

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:35.630
The class president knows everything. So don't mess with me.

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:37.900
Got it, Class President.

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:39.640
Dig in.

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:44.510
Hey. I had an immature thought back then.

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:47.810
When you had to miss school for your part-time job,

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:53.150
making your own money seemed like a whole other world to me.

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:56.190
You seemed so grown-up, you know?

00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:00.560
Working to pay bills and debts. I guess that is pretty grown-up.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:04.590
Hey, why the hard time? I'm trying to say you were cool.

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:07.729
Fine, whatever. Just eat.

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:09.269
It's really good. Try it.

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:11.030
- You made this? - Of course.

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:17.210
- Gosh, this is delicious. - Exactly.

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:20.409
Recommend a drink to pair with it.

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:21.980
Well, let me see.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:28.650
Here we go. It says right here.

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:29.820
A recommendation from the owner.

00:27:29.821 --> 00:27:33.060
It's 230 dollars? Did you forget you're treating me?

00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:35.430
I slipped into employee mode.

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:38.130
Also, the owner broke the bottle last time. Luckily.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.429
"Luckily?"

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:45.169
Fire! What do I do?

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:46.939
I'll take care of it. Just one moment.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:51.609
I've been waiting for this moment. See? I told you it'd come in handy!

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:52.710
Just a second!

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.640
Hey, excuse me!

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:56.749
Just a second!

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:58.480
Please step away.

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:02.290
Gosh, what is that?

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:05.420
Hey! Why use that?

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:19.170
Gosh, what is that?

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:21.910
Gosh, it actually works. You must be a firefighter.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.809
Are you all right?

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:25.840
- Yes. - Just water would've been fine.

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:28.910
Since she's your customer, you clean it all up.

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:31.780
No, she's our store's customer, so let's clean it up together.

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:39.660
So cool.

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:46.900
Do you think it's true Hae's been going into motels?

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:50.330
A kid like that transferred here? There goes the school's reputation.

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:54.600
Did you get into college or what? Take your gossip outside.

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:58.170
Guys, people are trying to study. Let's keep it down.

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.610
That includes you, Kim Seok Joo.

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:07.620
And it's not right to spread baseless rumours,

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.020
so please cut it out.

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:15.090
If you keep skipping classes, you might not be able to graduate.

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:19.230
You have a good shot at early entry with your special talent.

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:22.570
If you study, you could even aim for a reach school with regular entry.

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:25.469
Does it bug you that you've gone from a problem child...

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:27.199
to a special student with awards?

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:30.109
It feels like I'm cheating. Just by transferring to this school.

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:33.640
Then bend the rules to get by. You're allowed to.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.279
And what's this about George Clooney?

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.949
Are you changing your name? To George Clooney?

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:42.250
Sunwoo Clooney?

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:47.189
Those are both surnames. In Korea, it'd be like two last names.

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:49.129
Why am I even humouring you?

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:50.130
Unbelievable.

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:57.730
What did the homeroom teacher say?

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.000
She said to apply for early entry. But why bother?

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:05.410
It's because your grades are doomed. I've noticed you really don't study.

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:07.940
I told you to mind your attendance.

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:11.580
That's part of it, but I'm not going to college anyway.

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:15.020
What do you mean you're not going to college?

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:17.250
Some people just don't, you know?

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:21.890
Where are you going? It's lunchtime.

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.360
Hey, let's go! Run!

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:33.040
- Hurry up. - Here.

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:38.980
To wash down your meal.

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:42.010
What's this?

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:45.580
What's this candy for? Wait for me.

00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:00.200
Is it good?

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:05.030
This is actually good, all of a sudden.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.810
- How about you? Is it good? - It's super sweet.

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:16.649
- So why no school lunch? - I didn't pay. It's a waste.

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:20.580
But nutritionists plan those meals, checking every single ingredient,

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:22.050
so they're probably good for you.

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:23.990
Oh, I see.

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:37.230
Your way of thinking is better than I expected.

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:38.800
I'll have to use it more often.

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.339
(Sunwoo Hae, Cold)

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:43.440
Oh, you mean sleeping in the nurse's office?

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:45.580
Yes.

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:53.120
Give these to your little sister.

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:54.850
Glow-in-the-dark stars?

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:58.050
You can put them on the ceiling or stick them along her usual path.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.060
Why didn't I think of that?

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:04.490
Because I'm the one with the ideas? How will you get rich that way?

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:08.600
Forget what your mom wants for you. What do you want to be?

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:11.400
What? Me?

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.940
- Seoul National University? - That's a destination, not a dream.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:20.010
- I was asking what your dream is. - Do I have to have one?

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:26.880
I was just curious what someone as brilliant as you dreams about.

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.690
Hey!

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.860
Oh, stop! You're just saying that.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.460
Are you okay?

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.800
The sky is pretty.

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:10.860
Focus!

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.300
- I am focused. - Liar.

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:26.140
At least pretend to read.

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.250
Hae. There's a rumour going around.

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:42.860
Vice Principal, what's wrong? You have to at least hear him out.

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:45.960
A motel? A student going to motels?

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:49.030
I ignored the problems and accepted you as a special admission student,

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:55.569
and now there's word you were seen leaving a motel with a girl.

00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:57.639
How'd they see me? Were they a customer, too?

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.310
You should be apologising first!

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:04.780
I'm suspending you, so don't think about leaving home.

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:49.860
What? You actually came.

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:52.860
Do you like Sunwoo Hae?

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:55.830
Does Sunwoo Hae like you back?

00:34:57.870 --> 00:35:01.740
- Do you like Sunwoo Hae? - How did you know?

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:04.709
- You're ridiculous. - If I'm so funny, laugh.

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:08.680
How have you not changed at all? You've always been this weird.

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:15.450
Did you bring her here?

00:35:15.451 --> 00:35:17.249
You think she'd come just because I told her to?

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:21.620
Stop showing up where I am. I don't want your mom getting ideas.

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:26.000
I was curious if the rumour was true. About you and the motel.

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:29.400
- Why are you curious about that? - Because I thought she would be.

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.300
This is no fun.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.270
I'm leaving.

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:43.950
I'm not curious. I trust you.

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:45.980
It's him I don't trust.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.720
And you say that while you're here, in a place that's so not your scene?

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:52.090
Because it looked like you were struggling.

00:35:57.130 --> 00:35:58.329
Take it easy.

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:00.700
(Cheer up.)

00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:08.040
It's a part-time front desk job. There aren't many night jobs for me.

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:12.410
You should get going. Don't hang around a place like this.

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:14.440
- Okay. - Go.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:20.920
Bye!

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:31.030
Hey.

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:33.260
Gosh, what are you doing out so late?

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:39.170
Hey.

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:46.710
Come with me. She...

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:52.210
Ms. Pil Du said she'll pay off all our debt.

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.850
That woman is certainly paying a pretty penny for you.

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:57.250
What will you do about Nu Ri?

00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:01.720
I can't get in touch with her mother,

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.459
so for now, I was thinking of an orphanage...

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:07.330
Are you crazy? We'll survive on our own.

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:09.770
Don't you ever show up unannounced like this again.

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:13.240
Don't you remember what happened to your mother?

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:16.570
If you start getting sick,

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:19.940
we can't afford your medicine and hospital bills.

00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:23.180
And if I get sick and die, is she going to pay for that too?

00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:25.580
What, do I have some terminal illness?

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.319
- You wish I were dead, don't you? - Why would you say that?

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.190
To be honest, I wish I were too.

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:35.120
I'm sorry.

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:40.130
I'm so ashamed of what I've done to you and your mother.

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:42.400
Just leave me alone.

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:46.470
I'm barely holding on day by day.

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:50.740
Son.

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:32.010
I like her. How about you?

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:35.650
- You like her? - What are you talking about?

00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:39.789
All done. Grab your backpack.

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:40.860
You're going to be late for daycare.

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:44.889
I'm not going to daycare today. It's Children's Day.

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:45.900
I see.

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:50.470
If daycare's closed for the holiday, what should we do?

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:52.540
What should we do?

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:56.040
Do my hair again. I want to go to the amusement park.

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:17.130
Want to go on that one?

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:21.500
I want some ice cream.

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:25.470
That's a first. You want something? Should we go get it together?

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:28.440
My legs hurt.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:30.840
I'll wait over there.

00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:40.619
I'll be right back,

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:41.820
so don't wander off.

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:12.280
Excuse me, sorry to bother you.

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:14.679
Have you seen a small girl in yellow with pigtails?

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:16.190
She was sitting there.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:19.020
No, I don't think so. Sorry.

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:47.719
Excuse me. Have you seen a girl this tall with pigtails and a backpack?

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:50.620
- I haven't. - Sorry, I haven't seen her.

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:15.440
Eun Nu Ri!

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:26.160
I'm so sick of this.

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:43.510
A little girl in a yellow sweater, with a red backpack and pigtails.

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:48.339
Her guardian is looking for her. If you're with her or have seen her,

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:49.850
please notify a nearby staff member.

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:58.190
Is anyone in there?

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.020
The park is closing soon. You need to come out now.

00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:14.969
I'm Eun Nu Ri's guardian. Did you say you found her?

00:42:14.970 --> 00:42:18.710
Yes, a staff member found her. Oh, here they come now.

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:21.779
Oh, she said she was thirsty, so I was getting her some water.

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.380
I told you not to wander off.

00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:25.780
I was so afraid I'd lost you.

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:29.080
That I'd abandoned you.

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:32.520
Because I was hoping you'd lose me.

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:35.220
I just make things hard for you, don't I?

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:39.430
If I were gone, it might be a little easier on you.

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:44.630
You silly little thing. Is this why you wanted us to come here?

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:50.170
You're no trouble at all. This was the hardest day of my life.

00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:52.580
You hear me?

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:28.540
Not even looking at your book. What are you staring at?

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:30.650
The stars.

00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:34.420
I should've watched them from home. I've got plenty on my ceiling.

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:38.220
The star you're looking at. That's a satellite.

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:43.060
No wonder it was glowing so artificially.

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:53.300
Is it a satellite?

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:02.010
Sung Je Yeon.

00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:05.050
Yes?

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:11.350
Don't go.

00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:16.490
- What? - You didn't pay.

00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:20.299
Can't you see I left my bag behind?

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.230
But you take your wallet. Where is it?

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.270
Hand it over.

00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:29.240
You're always subtly making me out to be the one paying.

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.840
None of this is yours.

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:36.210
Hey, watch out.

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:39.520
You...

00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:41.950
Good grief.

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:58.930
If you plan to stay like this until morning assembly, give up.

00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:04.300
Summer break started today.

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:12.140
Gosh. Hey.

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:19.050
Hey.

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:25.890
So, what now? Off to work?

00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:28.920
Maybe I'll go to the bank, then head home and take a nap.

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:30.490
Hang out with me.

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:35.800
I've never really hung out for fun, so I might not be good at it.

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:37.670
Me neither.

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:40.070
Well...

00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:43.270
- Let's go to your bank first. - And then what?

00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:45.040
Well...

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.480
Wanna rob the bank?

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:52.710
Thank you for using our service.

(Deposit from Kim Pil Du, 1,000 dollars)

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:10.370
What's with the long face?

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:13.670
Did you not get your paycheck? Those bastards.

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:19.610
There's money coming in every month, but I hate the thought of using it.

00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:20.880
Even though I need it.

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:24.050
And it feels like a blow to my pride.

00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:26.950
What good is pride?

00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:30.520
Even when I'm mad at my mom, I still take the money she gives me.

00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:34.720
Don't be mad at your mom. Treat her well.

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:40.030
So, what should we do now?

00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:43.170
Normally, people would go to karaoke...

00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:45.170
or an Internet cafe, I guess?

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:47.300
What?

00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:52.979
No. We robbed a bank. Now, a bookstore.

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:54.510
You're such a model student.

00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:02.080
You keep smiling. I like that.

00:48:29.650 --> 00:48:31.650
(Driver's License Test Questions)

00:48:48.330 --> 00:48:49.330
Do you want it?

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:51.900
It's just...

00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:53.270
It's pretty.

00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:17.660
(Jin Mu Yeong's first novel, "Waegeum")

00:49:23.330 --> 00:49:24.630
- Let's go. - Okay.

00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:26.270
What?

00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:33.610
This is the new book.

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:39.110
By the way, what's "Waegeum?"

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:43.049
It's a type of apple. I used it because it sounded cool.

00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:44.150
So pretentious.

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:50.890
- Jin Mu Yeong? - It's my pen name.

00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:52.760
You even have a pen name?

00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:54.960
It's my mom's name.

00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:58.030
Gosh, your mom must be so proud.

00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:00.139
I hope she is.

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:02.299
I'll buy a copy, too. I promised, didn't I?

00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:04.910
- Just give me the cash. - No, I want the book.

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:21.160
It's a gift.

00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:26.500
And please sign the book with this, too.

00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:31.200
What's this for?

00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:36.340
- I don't have a signature. - How did you sign as a kid?

00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:38.070
I'd just write my name.

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:41.409
So what is this?

00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:44.350
It's a wish bracelet. I bought it for you.

00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:48.779
There are two of them. Are we supposed to share?

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:52.690
No, they're both for you. One is so you'll get rich.

00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:54.420
And the other one...

00:50:57.830 --> 00:50:58.890
You make the wish.

00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:05.200
Can you put it on for me? I don't think I can do it by myself.

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:06.640
Okay.

00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:26.560
Hoo.

00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:28.660
Hoo?

00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:30.190
You're hurt.

00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:32.130
I blew on it hard so it would heal quickly.

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:38.300
Sign it for me. For real.

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:07.560
I'm getting a signature for a tragic and beautiful book by a prodigy.

00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:09.300
Oh, stop.

00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:13.270
You know, this is the first time I've ever talked to a genius.

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:15.600
Hey, I said to cut it out.

00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:19.070
What? Even a genius' ears turn red.

00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:38.830
Doesn't this sound like ocean waves?

00:52:52.570 --> 00:52:55.610
You bring out the poet in me.

00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:58.480
Do you like the ocean?

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:02.750
Who doesn't love the ocean? What about you?

00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:31.010
I'm not sure. I've never really thought about it.

00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:40.190
Want to go to the ocean? Right now.

00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:43.730
We can go to the bus station and take the first bus anywhere.

00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:45.530
It's summer break.

00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:46.860
That way!

00:55:13.850 --> 00:55:16.020
I'd like this many of these flowers, please.

00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:18.790
I guess I'll have to get you a lot.

00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:34.270
Come here.

00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:49.120
When I'm with you,

00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:54.620
I forget all about my problems, which I know I shouldn't.

00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:01.800
I can't believe any of this is happening.

00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:05.170
It feels like I'm dreaming.

00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:10.000
I guess I really like you, too.

00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:17.650
But I have to focus on my studies right now, so,

00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:23.450
if I ask you out in college, will you go out with me?

00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:45.370
Whatever you're picturing at 20, Class President,

00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:47.040
please leave me out of it.

00:56:47.610 --> 00:56:48.610
Is it because of college?

00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:51.250
I'm a good student. You can do it too.

00:56:57.790 --> 00:57:01.320
Here's my number. If you have questions, call me...

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:03.360
When I'm with you, I keep...

00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:08.230
I don't have the energy for that. I don't, but still...

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:13.330
- I feel like I'm pouring it all. - You...

00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:17.769
don't like me? If you don't,

00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:18.840
then why are we here together?

00:57:20.070 --> 00:57:21.310
And why did you buy me flowers?

00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:27.020
I'm so sorry.

00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:30.349
I don't want an apology. I want to know.

00:57:30.350 --> 00:57:33.589
I just don't get it. I'm not asking you to date me now.

00:57:33.590 --> 00:57:37.130
When we're 20... Oh, right, you turned 20.

00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:39.360
Anyway.

00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:48.770
Is it me? Do you hate me?

00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:53.610
I hate myself. Me. It's me I hate.

00:57:54.010 --> 00:57:55.210
What are you talking about?

00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:56.580
No, what kind of crap is that?

00:57:57.450 --> 00:58:00.180
This is so ridiculous!

00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:34.780
You need to help me spell and go to work.

00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:36.480
Oh, right.

00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:46.930
I can write this from memory now.

Even if it's just once in a while,

00:59:20.430 --> 00:59:22.630
I want my world to feel beautiful.

00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:25.300
But...

00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:27.900
I feel like too much of that has happened today.

00:59:45.590 --> 00:59:46.590
It's just...

00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:51.330
Just until I graduate.

00:59:52.930 --> 00:59:54.060
For maybe one season,

00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:57.000
I guess I wanted to live like that.

00:59:58.230 --> 00:59:59.270
I did.

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.580
I...

01:00:11.850 --> 01:00:12.950
like her too.

01:00:32.970 --> 01:00:35.300
What? My family?

Je Yeon.

01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:59.690

- Mom. - Yes?

01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:04.200
- Are we broke? - We're not broke.

We're on our way to being broke.

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:09.669
You have to focus on your exams, so it's a secret...

01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:12.069
And you still want to drive this car when we're going broke?

01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:13.240
We're on our way to sell it!

How can everything fall apart all at once?

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:32.789
I mean, if we were going broke, you should have told me.

01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:35.330
I was worried it'd be a distraction. As your mother, I...

01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:38.730
- Darn it. - Are you crying?

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:43.810
When exactly did it start? I mean...

01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:47.440
If only I'd known yesterday... Seriously.

01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:52.850
I'd have told you I was struggling, that life is hard for me as well.

Hey! If you're here, why not come in?

01:03:08.490 --> 01:03:11.390

Okay, just hurry it up.

"Boss?" She must be rich then. Is that the cash you wouldn't spend?

01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:30.579
Why is it okay for her, but not for me?

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:33.210
Did you study so hard just to waste your energy in a place like this?

If I give you that stupid kiss, will you just go home?

I don't know. Guess we'll have to find out.

01:03:51.130 --> 01:03:52.230
Don't push me away this time.

01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:07.580

"Only?" My entire future is riding on this.

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.299
Exactly. So stake your future on that,

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:29.000
not on me. Now, go straight home.

01:04:29.170 --> 01:04:30.200
And don't ever come back.

Don't you act like you know me again!

01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:44.090
Ever!

01:05:04.410 --> 01:05:06.440
(Cheer up.)

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:24.560
It's sweet.

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:34.470
Gosh, the ice cream...

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:37.270
You just bought it for yourself, didn't you?

01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:41.880
Hey, I was worried it would melt since you were working.

01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:45.250
Yes, I get it. Enjoy.

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:52.650
Look at us, all grown up and sharing a drink.

01:05:57.390 --> 01:05:59.090
Are we, though? Really grown up?

01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:01.600
Well, I am.

01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:03.530
Guess you're not, right?

01:06:10.810 --> 01:06:14.410
So what happened with that show you were trying to cast for?

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:16.080
Why do you care?

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:17.809
It's not like you were going to do it anyway.

01:06:17.810 --> 01:06:20.880
I figured if you cast yourself, it must be important to you.

01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:29.190
I never pictured you as a manager.

01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:34.400
Well, I never thought you'd own a flower shop.

01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:38.030
This feels like a time warp.

01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:43.340
Did you go to college?

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.340
Yes, I did.

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:49.280
I had to get that scholarship.

01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:52.410
Was that my freshman year, second semester?

01:06:52.650 --> 01:06:55.819
I got beat for the top spot in our major back then.

01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:58.220
I was so mad, I could've killed them.

01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:03.860
I wondered if killing them would get me the scholarship.

01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:08.330
Anyway...

01:07:16.770 --> 01:07:18.170
Hey, you okay?

01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:20.810
I'm totally fine.

01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:23.880
She must be a lightweight.

01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:25.950
I hope she can walk on two feet.

01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:29.250
I barely even got to talk to her.

01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:34.260
Thanks.

01:07:44.730 --> 01:07:45.830
What?

01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:47.970
It's moving.

01:07:49.570 --> 01:07:50.640
But why?

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:53.270
You have to pay.

01:07:55.410 --> 01:07:56.710
Are you giving me a piggyback ride?

01:07:58.750 --> 01:08:02.820
I guess I let you drink too much. Are you okay?

01:08:04.050 --> 01:08:06.990
- What if I'm not? - Are you not?

01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:08.660
What if I am?

01:08:10.490 --> 01:08:11.560
Then it's time to get down.

01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:15.630
Light as a feather, aren't I?

01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:21.500
I'm only taking you to the taxi stop.

01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:25.710
Gosh, I'm drunk.

01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:37.490
Careful.

01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:45.589
I'll go get a hangover drink. Wait a second.

01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:46.630
Okay?

01:08:48.130 --> 01:08:49.300
Where's the convenience store?

01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:58.610
I guess I kind of wanted to see you.

01:09:03.710 --> 01:09:05.610
And I guess I was curious too.

01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:10.520
After you vanished into blackness,

01:09:11.850 --> 01:09:14.990
I wondered how you were living.

01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:20.260
How do you "vanish into blackness?" Is that some kind of poem?

01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:24.900
Because the roads you returned to...

01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:29.900
were so dark.

01:09:34.010 --> 01:09:35.740
Goodness.

01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:41.720
I must be drunk. I'm getting so emotional.

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:50.460
Gosh.

01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:56.460
I was curious about you too.

01:09:58.870 --> 01:10:00.700
If you'd gone off to college...

01:10:01.470 --> 01:10:03.800
or if you became one of the things on your mom's list.

01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:06.510
Whatever you became,

01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:09.080
I wondered if we would ever meet again.

01:10:10.810 --> 01:10:11.810
Stuff like that.

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:25.760
Should I do it?

01:10:27.730 --> 01:10:28.760
Do what?

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:32.900
That show with the actor you mentioned.

01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:39.410
- Why? - No reason, just...

01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:44.240
If the shop gets popular from TV, I can make a lot of money.

01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:48.680
My life's ambition is...

01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.990
to be rich, you know.

01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:57.550
(Focus!)

01:12:17.970 --> 01:12:20.840
(my youth)

01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:25.580
I'd be lying if I said I never thought about you.

01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:30.280
My path wasn't so dark. Thanks to you.

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:33.590
I wonder if this is what he meant by a new beginning.

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:37.359
I've decided to get along with you. At least until filming is over.

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:39.790
- It's Sunwoo Hae. - Wait, what's this? What happened?

01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:41.500
- What's going on? - Hey, Bebop.

01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:42.999
Hey, Beat.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.070
Do you find me awkward?

01:12:45.370 --> 01:12:47.300
No, not at all. Why would I?

01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:52.640
Sunwoo Hae's story is ideal for gossip, don't you think?

01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:53.910
Hey, Sunwoo Hae.

01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:58.250
Seriously, why did you agree to do the show?

01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:00.250
What's going to happen to us now?

=Voyage to Haihun, Season 1=

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.220
=Episode 2=

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.430
(What's going on?)

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.120
Heng!

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.000
(Did I die and come back?)

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.630
(I get it now.)

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:32.740
(Oh, my.)

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.280
(My injuries healed, and I was reborn.)

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.760
(That's like playing with cheats.)

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.680
Heng.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.120
I'll wait for your word.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.350
Lord Gong.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.790
It's me; open the door.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:43.750
(Forget it.)

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.870
Lord Gong, Lord Gong.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.480
Coming.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.230
About this Qilin matter...

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.370
Hey.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.040
We can't discuss it here.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.420
Let's speak in the study.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.260
- Hey.
- Let's go.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.970
No, we'll talk right here.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.200
Right here in the hall.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.340
Let your scolding cut deep

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.430
into my bones.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.460
Fine, since that's how it is,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.700
I must speak frankly today.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.370
Why did you set an altar by the river?

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.740
And why invite that so-called Immortal?

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.000
Do you truly believe in such hearsay?

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.960
Honestly, Lord Gong,

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.700
I've been missing

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.430
my late father deeply.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.280
By chance,
I stumbled upon this bronze Qilin.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.540
I heard

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.340
it can turn back time

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.630
and grant eternal life.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.630
I wish to see my father.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.500
Do you know

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.930
the origin of this bronze Qilin?

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.600
I recall it was gifted
by Grandfather to Grandmother

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.980
and then passed down to my father.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.100
Your grandmother
was gravely ill back then.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.340
Your grandfather
was deeply devoted to her.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.700
Of course, he believed such hearsay.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.620
There's no such thing as immortality
in this world.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.740
Assassins! Assassins!

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.860
Protect the Duke!

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.700
He's been caught?

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.090
The assassin was slain on the spot.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.180
Ah?

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.380
(20th day of the 5th month, 74 BC)

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.350
Heng.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.140
Heng.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:21.810
Heng.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.070
(Again?)

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.960
Heng.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.530
(Dying each time is unbearable.)

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.260
(I can't keep going like this.)

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.660
(I need to plan this carefully.)

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:35.940
You're not sneaking in?

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.500
Let's take a gamble.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.540
I'll go through the front gate.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.360
So bold and blatant?

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.480
(I can restart anytime;
what's there to fear?)

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.180
Ever heard of the invisibility spell?

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.440
I'm eager to see it.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:52.660
Lord Gong.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:53.540
It's me.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.520
Hurry, open the door!

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.320
Coming.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.460
(Where is he?)

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.620
- It's so late...
- Sorry

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.660
to disturb your peace.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.900
I admit I've been
far too reckless lately.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.680
It leaves me uneasy at heart.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.280
No one is without fault after all.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:17.300
Yes, yes.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.060
It matters that you can correct
your mistakes.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.600
Of course, I'll make amends.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:22.660
I lost my parents.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.840
(Two patrol squads outside.)

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.260
- Your words
- (Four per squad.)

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.380
- are like a father's counsel.
- (10 seconds to go.)

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.560
You flatter me.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.620
Please.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.270
(Inner shifts last 20 seconds.)

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.820
(Lord Gong's office is rather simple.)

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.720
Six, five.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.950
Four.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:18.840
Three.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.940
Two, one.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:20.820
Go.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.580
(Guards will pass the doorway)

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.420
(in three seconds.)

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.860
(Look back.)

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.920
(Right.)

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.950
(Left.)

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.140
(Right.)

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.150
(Left.)

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.380
(Turn.)

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.700
(Turn again.)

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.020
(Turn around. Bye.)

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.980
What's wrong?

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.840
I keep feeling
like someone's following us.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.480
Stop looking; it's eerie at night.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.420
Come on.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.340
Your grandmother
was gravely ill back then.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.310
Your grandfather
was deeply devoted to her.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.880
Of course, he believed such hearsay.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.130
There's no such thing as immortality
in this world.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.550
At last, I can sleep in peace.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.980
Duke, Duke.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.340
One more thing.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.180
Tell me next time.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.460
Next time.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.340
(Duke of Changyi's Mansion)

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.550
(No way to return.)

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.000
(I can only go to Chang'an
to reclaim the Qilin)

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.420
(and settle scores with San.)

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.300
(How did she get here anyway?)

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:39.380
Heng.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.260
Has it all gone smoothly?

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:43.860
The permits are done.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:44.860
What's wrong with you?

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.180
It's nothing. Let's go.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.660
Let's go back
and plan our trip to Chang'an.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.020
How are you?

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.700
You're too heavy to be an Immortal.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.420
You must've fallen from the heavens.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:16.380
(Duke of Changyi's Mansion)

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:17.300
Whoa.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:27.460
Lord Chen.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.300
Lord Gong,
the Duke is messing around again?

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.490
We can't afford to be careless now.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:47.760
What do you want?

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.140
Burn the bridge after crossing it?

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.030
Silence the witness?

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.000
- For you.
- What?

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.430
Your short hair
draws too much attention.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.140
After thinking it over,

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:00.980
this one

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.290
is the most practical

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.280
and precious.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.450
Let me tell you this:

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.460
Our body and hair
are gifts from our parents.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.220
Cutting hair is like cutting one's head.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.440
Such bonds are like those forged
in life and death.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.940
Will you do it yourselves,

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.340
or should I do it for you?

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:19.280
Duke.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:20.340
We've done nothing wrong!

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:21.220
Can't we talk?

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:22.740
- Why act like this?
- Looks like

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:24.980
I'll have to handle it myself.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.970
(Zhang Sheng, Chen Bushi, Li Qi)

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.760
(Well, at least I've got a wig.)

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.340
(I was worrying about this earlier.)

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.290
(I didn't expect Qi Chang)

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.460
(to be so considerate.)

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:35.660
Now, we have the travel permits.

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.100
But let me remind you:

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:38.540
The road to Chang'an is long.

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.100
How will we manage food and lodging?

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.860
How about expenses on the way?

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.540
Mm.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.900
Will this be enough?

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.380
(Oh, my.)

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.340
(Gold biscuit.)

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.100
(This guy must know Liu He.)

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:55.140
I fear

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:56.540
it won't suffice.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:00.620
I still have

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.580
a few more.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:02.880
How about

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:04.040
we go take a look?

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.120
Let's go see.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:06.700
Come on.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:12.960
(This...)

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.660
(Wow...)

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:16.510
(This...)

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.440
(Aren't these the ones in the museum)

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.940
(that you can only view through glass)

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.160
(and can't even touch at all?)

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.100
(Why are they piled here
like common greens?)

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.990
(And I'm allowed to touch them freely?)

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:26.260
(Oh, my heavens!)

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.660
(The perks of time travel are too real!)

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:29.820
They're all yours?

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:31.300
Heng.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.040
Will this be enough
for the trip to Chang'an?

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.300
Yes, yes.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:37.540
That's more than enough.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.780
A coffin like this

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.020
not only shields us

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.970
but can also hide

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.450
the man without an identity.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.960
Most importantly,

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.720
he can keep our travel funds safe.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:51.700
Brilliant.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.740
Truly ingenious.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.420
Follow me out of the city.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:55.540
Move.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.000
We're at a funeral; be serious.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.100
Mind your demeanor.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:00.560
You too, get back in there. Lie down.

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:01.820
I'm playing my part.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.160
With so much money beside me,

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.480
I could rest in peace with a smile.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:09.920
- Go.
- Go.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:13.090
Halt.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:14.200
Another funeral procession?

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:15.640
Why have there been so many lately?

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.220
Sir, this is a permit from Lord Gong.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.460
Sir, you may not be aware.

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:20.370
There's been a contagious disease.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.690
The whole family dies together.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:22.860
It's something that spreads.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:23.600
That's uncanny.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.450
Hurry, hurry.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:25.500
Don't let it spread to us.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:31.590
It feels different outside the city.

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:32.620
Look.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.420
Do you see that?

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:35.870
These rivers and mountains.

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:37.260
The splendor beyond Changyi.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.480
Leaving the city

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.120
is the first step.

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.430
Go buy this carriage at once.

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:48.180
- Go.
- You two, go.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.050
Go, go, go.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:49.920
Faster.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.470
Offer him any price he asks.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:53.650
Got it.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:57.970
Qi,

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.110
while clutching these gold biscuits,

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.810
I can't help but wonder two things.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:02.800
First,

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.280
are you well acquainted with Liu He?

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.220
Keep your voice down.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.440
You're a corpse now.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.140
Second,

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.420
since you know Lord Gong,

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.620
could it be that you're...?

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:11.560
You surely talk a lot.

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:12.700
I just got here,

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:13.940
so I don't know the situation.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:16.230
You report.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.120
No, I won't.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.420
What happened?

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:20.700
Where's the carriage?

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:21.540
You should go

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:23.500
and talk about it yourself.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.590
Didn't I say to agree
to whatever price he asks?

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:28.140
Just name your price.

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:29.630
I'll buy it no matter the cost.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.150
Duke.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.830
Please, come back with me.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:45.520
Let's sit and talk.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:49.550
What's going on?

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:51.120
Is the Duke you mentioned Liu He?

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.500
- Come out.
- Take them all back.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.860
Did he leave the city with us?

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.020
Qi Chang, say something.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.540
(Changyi Gate)

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:08.860
Lord Gong.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.440
They've been kneeling for so long.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.050
First, they believed rumors.

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:16.830
Then they stole my seal with a vagrant

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:18.340
and stirred up

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:19.540
this whole shameful mess.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:23.060
I only wish to live a life of freedom

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:24.740
and become a wandering hero.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.060
Why not seize the chance?

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.220
Right now in Chang'an,

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.280
the winds of power shift endlessly.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:35.660
His Majesty lies gravely ill.

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:37.880
Every word and move you make

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:39.660
is under the court's gaze.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:42.230
One day...

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:43.540
Lord Gong,

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.140
how dare you

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:47.940
speak of that?

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:51.260
Acting with the tide is the wiser path.

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:54.100
Do not be misled by petty schemers.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.060
At such a critical moment,

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.060
if you lose your clarity,

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.180
the loss will outweigh the gain.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.060
What plans are in motion in Chang'an?

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:07.900
Now that His Majesty is gravely ill,

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.380
what Chang'an needs is

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.390
an obedient heir

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.700
with a few achievements.

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:16.180
Equine administration

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:17.870
is a key policy of the Han.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:19.780
Lord Gong.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.360
You know what must be done.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.500
At this moment,

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.320
the equine administration

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.160
will strengthen your power.

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:33.340
Why execute me?

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.240
What crime have I committed?

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.890
Spreading deceitful words

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:38.080
and swaying the Duke's will.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.040
That is a capital crime.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.240
This was all Qi Chang's doing.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:41.200
I've never met the Duke.

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:42.650
When have I ever swayed him?

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:44.150
You must've caught the wrong person.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:46.160
Go, hurry.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.520
You are Wang Heng?

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.060
(Xu Qingge)

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.220
(Order)

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.220
- Let him go.
- Yes.

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:56.030
Qi Chang's friend?

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.140
And you are?

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:58.920
Qi has already pleaded for you.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.420
If you wish to live,

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:02.060
you just need to do one thing.

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:03.870
What is it?

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.220
Equine administration.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:06.180
What?

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.350
You don't know,

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.260
so you can't do that.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:09.460
So, that's a no.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:10.830
Take him out and behead him.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:11.780
I know.

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:12.620
I can do this.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:13.780
I agree.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.380
Alright, release him.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:17.560
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:18.860
Hurry, hurry.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:20.180
Hurry.

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.250
You can let me go?

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:27.940
Seems like in Changyi,

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:29.700
you're quite an influential figure.

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.240
I'm Xu Qingge.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.700
Just like Qi,

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.530
I'm also the Duke's confidant.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:35.660
Come with me.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:46.820
So,

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.020
you agreed then.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:54.220
Hey.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.650
Isn't this the Duke's confidant?

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:57.970
Since you're here,

00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.700
why not explain yourself?

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:03.480
You should thank me first.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:04.900
I pleaded for you

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:06.350
and said you were worth keeping.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.540
That's how you were spared.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:08.480
Why didn't you tell me

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.820
you took the Duke out of the city?

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.040
I need to see the Duke.

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:13.920
The Duke isn't someone you can meet.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.320
If I meet the Duke,

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:16.820
I promise

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.620
everyone will be able to go to Chang'an.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.700
(He doesn't even know I'm the Duke)

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:23.440
(and dares to try and fool me.)

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.580
You won't get to see him.

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:28.420
Why not?

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:30.770
His intent to leave was exposed.

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:32.300
He's now in seclusion for reflection.

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.380
No one gets to see him.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:35.270
Really?

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:36.340
(She made that up.)

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:37.340
(And you bought it.)

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:38.470
Qingge.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:39.660
Go fetch a horse.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:45.860
Just now, you said

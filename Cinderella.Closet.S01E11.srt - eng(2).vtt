00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:06.539
How long have you had feelings for me?

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:11.277
I probably liked you from the beginning.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:33.233
What? Mom?

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:34.534
Good, you're home.

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:36.036
- Mom?
- Long time no see

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:37.237
It's been a while.

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:38.605
How've you been?

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:42.809
So? You been working hard?

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.577
Yeah, I have.

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:45.879
Everything good?

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:46.813
Why?

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.882
I was meeting a friend in Tokyo,

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:51.584
so I thought I'd swing by
with some sweets.

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:55.622
- Sure, but you could've called ahead!
- Sorry.

00:00:58.358 --> 00:00:59.225
Hello.

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:01.394
Nice to meet you.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:03.630
Nice to meet you.

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.676
So, Mom.

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:20.246
Wait, hold on.

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:22.816
Do I introduce him as my boyfriend?

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:25.618
But we just started dating.

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:27.720
This seems too soon!

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:28.621
Um,

00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:31.724
I have the privilege of dating Haruka.

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:33.460
I'm Hikaru Kamiyama.

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:35.028
Nice to meet you.

00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:37.797
My.

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:41.267
Someone like you is dating Haruka?

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.372
Wait, you look kind of familiar.

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:53.213
This?

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:58.184
It's not what you think!

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.721
I mean, it is.

00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:06.226
I'm sorry!

00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:09.762
Why are you apologizing?

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:13.666
I mean… You're not surprised?

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:15.368
It's lovely!

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:18.238
Boys these days wear makeup, right?

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:20.740
They do, but this is…

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:21.875
So cute!

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:27.847
I have to hurry or I'll miss my bus!

00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:29.249
I have to go.

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:36.723
I'm so sad, I wanted to meet
the Hikaru from the picture too.

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:39.125
See you again.

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:41.961
Hold on, I'll walk you to the bus stop.

00:02:42.028 --> 00:02:43.163
I'm fine!

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:45.698
Could I just borrow the bathroom first?

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:46.633
Sure.

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.507
- Hey, Haruka.
- Yeah?

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:55.675
Got a sec?

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:58.778
PLATFORM 3
TO TAKASAKI

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:00.580
- Really?
- Yes, really.

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:02.248
This is your only luggage?

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:10.490
Thank you for waiting.

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:15.862
Hikaru wanted to dress up like the picture
for you before you left.

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:17.397
You did that for me?

00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:20.600
Sorry, I didn't have time to change.

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:23.169
He went all the way home to do this.

00:03:23.236 --> 00:03:24.237
Really?

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:25.705
I'm so happy!

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:28.508
Right, can you take a picture?

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:30.376
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:31.244
Thanks.

00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:33.479
Ready? Say cheese!

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:36.549
Nice.

00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:37.617
Here.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:41.721
So cute!

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:43.690
I'm satisfied now.

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:45.391
You're so over the top.

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:46.626
I mean,

00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:50.530
back when you first came to Tokyo,

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:52.432
you called me all the time,

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:54.567
and I was worried how lonely you seemed.

00:03:55.768 --> 00:03:59.606
But lately, you sound so happy
and full of life on the phone.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.542
It must be thanks to you.

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.611
Oh, no. It's nothing.

00:04:04.677 --> 00:04:09.849
I thought she might fall for
some weird guy living alone in Tokyo.

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:16.456
But with someone like you,
I can be at ease.

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:22.028
Please take care of Haruka for me.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.129
Of course.

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:24.230
I'll do my best.

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:30.103
You two should come over sometime!

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:32.805
So everyone can meet him.

00:04:32.872 --> 00:04:34.807
Mom was so happy!

00:04:34.874 --> 00:04:36.542
Thank you, Hikaru!

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.212
Oh, sure. My pleasure.

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:53.926
Sorry, I appreciate you humoring my mom.

00:04:53.993 --> 00:04:55.061
It's not that!

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:00.833
Sorry.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.336
I was in such a rush,

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.340
I only had time for makeup.
I didn't even get changed.

00:05:07.407 --> 00:05:11.077
I feel really anxious
having my look so incomplete.

00:05:12.612 --> 00:05:14.580
I don't want you seeing me like this.

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:18.985
That's so you!

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:20.753
Your sense of fashion is so high!

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:21.654
Huh?

00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:25.992
I guess really stylish people
never cut corners.

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:29.295
That's not what I meant.

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:32.932
By the way, you've been dressing
like a boy a lot lately.

00:05:33.966 --> 00:05:36.903
I was hoping to see girl Hikaru, too.

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:40.740
That's okay?

00:05:41.307 --> 00:05:42.075
Huh?

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:47.780
Well.

00:05:49.248 --> 00:05:52.585
I don't want to trouble you
since we're dating now.

00:05:53.252 --> 00:05:54.354
Trouble me?

00:05:55.988 --> 00:06:00.727
Being with such a genderfluid guy,

00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:03.996
you don't mind?

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:06.599
I mean,

00:06:10.303 --> 00:06:14.607
I like any version of you,
whether you're a boy or a girl.

00:06:24.117 --> 00:06:24.951
Hikaru?

00:06:25.952 --> 00:06:29.355
Your and your mom are just the same.

00:06:29.422 --> 00:06:31.724
Does it run in your family?

00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:33.593
Your genetics?

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:37.230
Huh? What do you mean?

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:43.269
I wish I was born into your family.

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:50.209
That wouldn't be right.

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:54.981
We can't date if we're siblings.

00:07:15.468 --> 00:07:17.236
I thought you were crying.

00:07:21.207 --> 00:07:23.409
I'm glad I met you.

00:07:48.067 --> 00:07:50.636
Hikaru looked so happy
when he was smiling

00:07:50.703 --> 00:07:52.672
that I forgot to tell him.

00:07:53.539 --> 00:07:56.676
That I'm glad I met him, too.

00:07:57.944 --> 00:08:01.547
I thought these happy times
would last forever.

00:08:02.114 --> 00:08:03.950
You haven't slept with Hikaru yet?

00:08:06.118 --> 00:08:09.889
You've been dating a while now, right?

00:08:09.956 --> 00:08:12.058
You don't need to tell me.

00:08:12.124 --> 00:08:13.159
Sorry.

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:14.927
Everyone has their own pace.

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:16.329
That's not it.

00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:21.167
Hikaru has been really busy
since becoming Tohko Miyoshi's assistant.

00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:23.503
Tohko Miyoshi, the hair and makeup artist?

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:25.371
So you do know her?

00:08:25.438 --> 00:08:28.741
Of course, she's the most famous one
in Japan!

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:32.545
He's already become an assistant
before even graduating?

00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:34.747
He's so impressive!

00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:38.651
And he still finds the time
to meet with me.

00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:44.891
You were shooting all night, right?

00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:46.626
Are you sleeping?

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:49.428
You go to school, then straight to work.

00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:51.631
I'm worried about you.

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:54.333
Aren't you happy?

00:08:54.967 --> 00:08:56.836
I came because I wanted to see you.

00:08:57.703 --> 00:08:58.838
I'm hurt.

00:09:00.406 --> 00:09:02.375
Of course I'm happy.

00:09:03.342 --> 00:09:04.176
But

00:09:05.511 --> 00:09:08.014
I'm sorry I'm too busy
to take you anywhere.

00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:12.118
I freed up this weekend
if you want to come over.

00:09:13.319 --> 00:09:14.220
Really?

00:09:21.193 --> 00:09:22.194
Hikaru?

00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:23.462
Hold on. Wait.

00:09:23.529 --> 00:09:24.730
I can't.

00:09:24.797 --> 00:09:25.865
It's your fault.

00:09:25.932 --> 00:09:27.767
Can we just stay like this?

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:29.735
Hikaru.

00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:40.046
Hikaru?

00:09:43.382 --> 00:09:45.151
Poor thing.

00:09:45.217 --> 00:09:49.255
But it's only natural for the less busy
person to be accommodating.

00:09:49.322 --> 00:09:51.991
I just have school and my part-time job.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.330
Wait, that's all I have.

00:09:58.164 --> 00:09:59.632
In that case…

00:10:04.337 --> 00:10:06.038
- Sorry, I know you're busy.
- It's fine.

00:10:06.806 --> 00:10:09.508
Here are the new product samples
I told you about.

00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:12.211
- Can you stay for one drink?
- Sure.

00:10:13.512 --> 00:10:14.714
Are you seeing Haruka?

00:10:15.915 --> 00:10:16.983
Thanks to her.

00:10:18.117 --> 00:10:21.120
She's adjusting her schedule for me,
so that helps.

00:10:21.187 --> 00:10:24.624
Too bad. I thought I had a chance
if you hadn't been seeing her.

00:10:25.491 --> 00:10:28.661
I'm listening to you gush about her,
so let me have this.

00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:31.063
Sorry.

00:10:37.803 --> 00:10:38.838
Sorry I'm late.

00:10:38.904 --> 00:10:40.306
Don't worry.

00:10:40.373 --> 00:10:42.475
- Thanks for making time for me.
- Of course.

00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:44.844
I just need to work tonight.

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:46.479
Let's go.

00:10:48.114 --> 00:10:49.548
What's your job today?

00:10:50.416 --> 00:10:51.684
A magazine article.

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:55.888
I wish I could spend all day with you.

00:10:55.955 --> 00:10:58.624
I'm happy enough to get you until evening.

00:11:00.126 --> 00:11:01.060
You heal me.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.299
I decided to learn from your example.

00:11:08.934 --> 00:11:11.604
I'm going to help Miorin out.

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:15.141
If you're working this hard, I should too!

00:11:17.977 --> 00:11:21.380
I don't think it's as easy
as you think it is.

00:11:23.249 --> 00:11:25.284
But I already decided to do it.

00:11:26.552 --> 00:11:27.420
Well.

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:31.057
If it's something you want to do,
I support you.

00:11:38.964 --> 00:11:40.633
Sorry about that.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.302
I tried to goad you on purpose.

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:44.236
You did?

00:11:45.137 --> 00:11:48.908
I mean, if you get busy too,

00:11:48.974 --> 00:11:51.110
we'll have less time to see each other.

00:11:53.846 --> 00:11:56.248
You're being jealous, aren't you?

00:11:56.315 --> 00:11:59.085
- I am. Is that a bad thing?
- Not really.

00:12:03.355 --> 00:12:04.590
Is that the place?

00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:07.326
Sorry, one sec.

00:12:12.064 --> 00:12:13.065
Hello?

00:12:13.132 --> 00:12:13.999
Yes.

00:12:15.801 --> 00:12:17.169
Come to the office now?

00:12:20.372 --> 00:12:21.207
Okay.

00:12:22.475 --> 00:12:23.442
Understood.

00:12:27.313 --> 00:12:28.147
Sorry.

00:12:28.214 --> 00:12:30.950
Work? Don't worry about me and go.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.953
I promise to go by your place tonight!

00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:34.920
I'm sorry!

00:12:37.456 --> 00:12:39.024
- Give it your all!
- I will!

00:12:49.368 --> 00:12:51.504
I'm finally finished!

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:54.473
Thanks for helping me edit.

00:12:55.174 --> 00:12:58.978
I feel like you spent most of the time
teaching me how.

00:12:59.044 --> 00:13:01.313
I was like that starting out too.

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.083
But I love it, so it was worth the effort.

00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:08.287
Something you love.

00:13:09.388 --> 00:13:11.857
Wanna celebrate finishing?

00:13:12.858 --> 00:13:14.693
I can go buy us snacks.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.594
Thanks.

00:13:29.708 --> 00:13:30.743
Hello?

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.044
Sorry about earlier.

00:13:32.778 --> 00:13:34.980
It's okay, I went to help Miorin.

00:13:35.681 --> 00:13:36.549
I see.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.252
But you seem down.

00:13:41.754 --> 00:13:42.721
Did something happen?

00:13:43.756 --> 00:13:44.690
No.

00:13:46.792 --> 00:13:50.930
It's amazing that both you and Miorin
found something you love.

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:54.800
I was just thinking that I have nothing.

00:13:57.536 --> 00:13:58.537
Sorry!

00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:01.807
Wait, are you by yourself?

00:14:01.874 --> 00:14:02.942
Wanna drink with us?

00:14:03.709 --> 00:14:06.011
- Sorry, he's drunk…
- My treat.

00:14:06.645 --> 00:14:07.646
Cut it out.

00:14:10.449 --> 00:14:11.617
Mr. Kurotaki?

00:14:13.452 --> 00:14:14.954
Oh, you have a boyfriend.

00:14:19.258 --> 00:14:21.360
Sorry! You there, Hikaru?

00:14:22.228 --> 00:14:23.929
Why are you with Kurotaki?

00:14:30.736 --> 00:14:33.239
{\an8}I just ran into her on my way home.

00:14:33.305 --> 00:14:35.875
Talk about a coincidence!

00:14:36.408 --> 00:14:39.211
Okay, I get what happened.

00:14:39.278 --> 00:14:41.413
Now that that's cleared up!

00:14:42.081 --> 00:14:43.148
Let's get back to it.

00:14:43.215 --> 00:14:44.183
Cheers!

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:45.885
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.390
{\an8}Mio, don't overwork Haruka.
She has classes to attend to.

00:14:51.457 --> 00:14:53.192
You're working with Mio?

00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:55.661
Don't butt in.

00:14:56.929 --> 00:14:59.098
She says she wants to do it.

00:14:59.164 --> 00:14:59.999
So support her.

00:15:00.065 --> 00:15:01.467
{\an8}That's none of your business!

00:15:01.533 --> 00:15:03.669
Hey, Hikaru!

00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:08.474
Hikaru, only insecure men get jealous,
you hear me?

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.142
- What?!
- "You hear me?"

00:15:10.209 --> 00:15:12.044
Are you drunk, Miorin?

00:15:13.045 --> 00:15:16.248
Um, I'll go talk to him alone.

00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:28.360
It really was a coincidence
running into Mr. Kurotaki.

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:29.495
Yeah, I know.

00:15:30.663 --> 00:15:33.165
You have nothing to worry about.

00:15:33.232 --> 00:15:35.701
I swear, he did nothing wrong.

00:15:37.469 --> 00:15:39.872
So? Is that all you wanted to say?

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:42.341
- No.
- You want to try harder, right?

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:45.878
Then should you be partying now?

00:15:48.247 --> 00:15:50.182
Why are you being so mean?

00:15:51.183 --> 00:15:52.851
Oh, no, I didn't mean to--

00:15:52.918 --> 00:15:53.919
Kamiyama?

00:15:54.687 --> 00:15:55.521
Yes?

00:15:56.322 --> 00:15:59.792
Sorry, you're at work.
I'll talk to you later.

00:16:00.659 --> 00:16:02.361
Wait, Haruka?

00:16:09.301 --> 00:16:11.470
How did things come to this?

00:16:18.777 --> 00:16:20.679
Sorry about everything.

00:16:21.914 --> 00:16:25.217
I was panicking
that I had nothing going on.

00:16:26.518 --> 00:16:30.356
But I'm sure Hikaru doesn't know
what to do either.

00:16:30.956 --> 00:16:34.159
Having nothing going on? I get that.

00:16:36.795 --> 00:16:39.531
Also, what's with the distance?

00:16:40.099 --> 00:16:41.300
I'm sorry.

00:16:42.234 --> 00:16:45.838
I don't want to do anything
that might upset Hikaru.

00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:48.607
You're still as earnest as ever.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:55.914
Wouldn't a girl normally feel happy,
instead of inferior?

00:16:55.981 --> 00:16:57.883
If their boyfriend is so impressive.

00:16:59.184 --> 00:17:00.152
Well,

00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:05.090
Hikaru's my lover but also my best friend.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.994
I want to be equal.

00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:11.497
So we can be together forever.

00:17:12.264 --> 00:17:13.766
Equal, huh?

00:17:17.336 --> 00:17:18.203
But

00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:22.374
it's rare for someone to know
what they want to do from the start.

00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:29.748
And Mio and Hikaru are on another level
since they're successful at it.

00:17:29.815 --> 00:17:31.050
Another level?

00:17:31.116 --> 00:17:32.084
Normally,

00:17:33.385 --> 00:17:35.854
you have to try a few things
to figure that out.

00:17:38.023 --> 00:17:40.592
I'm on the "have nothing" side too.

00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:43.896
So

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:47.166
I try different things.

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:51.303
And I'm not limiting my job search
to Tokyo either.

00:17:52.004 --> 00:17:52.938
Really?

00:17:57.443 --> 00:17:58.811
How about the two of us

00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:02.381
expand our horizons and try our best?

00:18:06.852 --> 00:18:08.053
- Yes!
- Nice.

00:18:09.054 --> 00:18:09.888
Good answer.

00:18:14.426 --> 00:18:17.663
{\an8}Mr. Kurotaki is still so cool.

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:21.366
{\an8}He's still someone I admire,
just like before.

00:18:22.534 --> 00:18:23.769
{\an8}But…

00:18:23.836 --> 00:18:24.703
{\an8}Wait.

00:18:26.205 --> 00:18:27.506
{\an8}I'm okay here.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.409
{\an8}What if guys mess with you again?

00:18:30.476 --> 00:18:31.343
{\an8}I'll walk you.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:33.645
{\an8}No, I'll be fine.

00:18:33.712 --> 00:18:35.814
{\an8}I don't feel the way I feel for Hikaru.

00:18:37.983 --> 00:18:40.586
{\an8}The one I want to be with forever

00:18:41.186 --> 00:18:42.521
{\an8}is Hikaru.

00:18:43.589 --> 00:18:46.425
{\an8}Thank you so much for everything.

00:18:58.871 --> 00:18:59.905
{\an8}Hey, it's me.

00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:04.877
{\an8}- What? Why are you--
- Do you remember what you said to me once?

00:19:05.911 --> 00:19:08.147
{\an8}- What?
- About Haruka.

00:19:08.947 --> 00:19:12.184
{\an8}"Cherish her.
I'll kill you if you hurt her."

00:19:14.453 --> 00:19:15.587
{\an8}That's rich.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:20.492
{\an8}You better come get her.

00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:23.228
{\an8}Or else

00:19:25.731 --> 00:19:26.832
{\an8}I'm taking her back.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.575
{\an8}Do you know why lovers give rings?

00:19:36.642 --> 00:19:38.844
{\an8}Just keep thinking only about me.

00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:40.145
{\an8}Well, good luck.

00:19:40.212 --> 00:19:42.247
{\an8}If you're unhappy, I feel hurt as well.

00:19:44.383 --> 00:19:45.884
{\an8}There was an accident.

00:19:45.951 --> 00:19:47.186
{\an8}Hikaru?

00:19:47.252 --> 00:19:48.120
{\an8}No.

00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:49.755

(Courtesan Ranking of Meixiang House)

00:02:22.931 --> 00:02:24.352
(Xiyan)

00:02:33.012 --> 00:02:35.168
(Xiyan)

00:02:36.724 --> 00:02:38.176
(Xiyan)

00:02:43.251 --> 00:02:44.275
(Xiyan)

00:02:44.468 --> 00:02:47.904
(Xiyan)

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:51.360
(Xiyan)

00:02:54.292 --> 00:02:56.672
(Xiyan)

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.880
It's Lady Xiyan.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.800
Truly the disciple of Qingmei.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.920
Alluring yet refined.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.960
If you ask me,

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.600
she'll surely be the top courtesan.

00:03:17.728 --> 00:03:18.800
Exactly!

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.960
Lady Xiyan.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.960
Master,

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.240
I heard the Prince Regent
returned victorious.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.000
All officials paid tribute.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.600
The Governor of Huzhou summoned
the top courtesan from Meixiang House.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.400
Master,

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.880
may I go with you?

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.520
The Governor wanted the top courtesan.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.000
Therefore,

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.920
only the top courtesan may go.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.920
Unless,

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.880
you wish to replace me?

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.440
You're not prepared.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.960
Master,

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.720
I've prepared for three years.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.000
Lady Qingmei,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.040
your palanquin awaits.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.080
Lady Qingmei.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.520
Lady Qingmei?

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.840
Are you okay?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.760
You...

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.160
You ungrateful fool!

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.200
I'll report to the authorities.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.400
Report if you must.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.360
But Madam,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.800
how will you explain

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.600
to the Governor?

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.560
I know you value

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.760
loyalty above all.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.920
But

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.440
circumstances dictate otherwise.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.640
Qingmei's face is ruined.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.480
From now on,

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.720
I am the top courtesan here.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.440
The one attending the banquet

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.960
shall be me alone.

00:06:32.372 --> 00:06:35.072
(Prince Regent's Mansion)

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.480
Pei Ji,

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.480
to frame a crime,
excuses are never lacking.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.400
You slaughtered court officials.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.408
Heaven will not...

00:06:57.555 --> 00:07:01.120
(Pei Ji, Prince Regent)

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.040
Officials of rank one to four

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.800
almost have been killed.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.400
Summon the Governor of Huzhou.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.960
Present the gift.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.400
Your Highness, watch out!

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.400
Cease your panic.

00:08:08.928 --> 00:08:09.880
Leave us.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.720
- Understood.
- Understood.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.200
You really thought
you can assassinate me?

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.160
Your Highness,

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.400
the courtesan acted alone.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.440
I knew nothing about it.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.520
Spare me, Your Highness!

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.360
Even if senile,

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.960
you wouldn't hire

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.600
a defenseless woman for assassination.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.400
You appear wise,

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.240
yet prove utterly foolish.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.560
What?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.160
By the Governor's commission,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.360
I came to entertain you.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.520
But your mind appears set.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.760
Any tribute offered

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.160
becomes these officials' death warrant.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.480
Since death awaits regardless,

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.760
I'll stake my life

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.800
to protect my patron.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.240
Though your foolish loyalty is absurd,

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.640
you're better than the learned villains.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.360
I fight for the kingdom,

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.400
while you plot corruption.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.480
Even a courtesan shows more integrity.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.120
Get lost.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.880
This old fool's fate concerns you not.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.920
You praised me,

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.240
seeming pleased.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.600
But you didn't spare the Governor.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.480
I don't understand.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.000
Are you satisfied with me

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.200
or not?

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.760
You're the first

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.200
who tried to assassinate me

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.320
and still keep your head.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.840
You are also the first

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.640
whose wish I failed to fulfill

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.920
with my performance.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.960
You make it sound as if I'm ignorant.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.240
Your Highness, dare you

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.080
make a wager with me?

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.720
Wager the Governor of Huzhou

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.680
and your life.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.040
As

00:10:39.904 --> 00:10:40.840
your wish.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.480
No, Your Highness!

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.840
I don't want to die.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.600
They say your archery skills are divine.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.720
You can pierce an enemy's throat
from a hundred paces,

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.120
crushing the northern forces.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.840
This fan holds four jade beads.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.880
If I complete my dance

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.120
and you shoot down all the beads,

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:32.840
you win.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.800
If you fail,

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.040
spare the Governor.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:38.880
Is that acceptable?

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.200
Start the music.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.560
Your Highness, thanks to your grace.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.040

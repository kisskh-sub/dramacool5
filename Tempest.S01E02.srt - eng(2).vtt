00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:18.936
TEMPEST

00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:54.972
Sir.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:10.529
Sir, I don't know what…
…what I'm--

00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:17.953
{\an8}TWO MONTHS BEFORE
JANG JUNIK'S ASSASSINATION

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.373
How reliable is your intelligence?

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:22.791
Well, we can trust the satellites,

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:25.335
but the real question is,
how did they build it?

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:28.046
It's not possible
without Russian and Chinese cooperation.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.132
Which means their tacit approval here
is a given.

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:32.009
Better believe they have
the resolve to launch those missiles.

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:34.136
Yeah, I'm afraid
I agree with the chairman.

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:35.637
Mr. President.

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:39.850
Sit down, everyone.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.011
Hey.

00:02:16.595 --> 00:02:17.721
Really appreciate it.

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:20.807
- All right, take care. Travel safe.
- Of course.

00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:21.975
All right.

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.487
Hello there, sir.
The two of us spoke on the phone.

00:03:12.234 --> 00:03:13.485
I had a dream.

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.697
In the dream,

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:18.990
I was a woman.

00:03:19.825 --> 00:03:24.996
For South Koreans,
people in North Korea are not just anyone.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.790
{\an8}IRAQ, 2023

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:30.585
{\an8}Millions of South Koreans
still have our family members

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.171
and relatives living in the north.

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:37.426
To us, they're still
our brothers and sisters.

00:03:38.427 --> 00:03:43.432
Far into the future when we look back
and think about what we have done,

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:46.893
I sincerely hope that
we will be able to say

00:03:46.977 --> 00:03:50.647
that we did the right thing
for the people in North Korea

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:56.903
{\an8}who deserve to live a decent life,
just like us.

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.323
Even in a storm…

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:03.910
…I wanted to run.

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.177
JANG JUNIK

00:04:24.306 --> 00:04:26.558
When did my husband
tell you to increase security?

00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:30.270
- I'm sorry?
- It wasn't so heavy before?

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:32.439
He was clearly on edge about something.

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:34.149
I'm wondering, Changhee.

00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:35.817
You know his routine.

00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:37.194
Everything about him.

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:40.739
It was a few months ago.

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:45.285
He began taking personal calls
and meetings in complete secrecy.

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:47.537
- I was kept out of it.
- …make time soon to talk.

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:49.748
I received a letter from the States.

00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:52.375
I need to discuss it with you.

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:56.296
Hey, where are you…
Sir, where are you going?

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:57.380
Mmm.

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:01.760
He was especially anxious
the day before you got back.

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:04.054
He requested
that I double the security team.

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:06.598
And then he asked for a detour
on the simplest route.

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:08.683
But, sir, may I ask you
what this is about?

00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:16.775
A squirrel is following us.

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:19.277
A squirrel?

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:52.018
When Junsang was young,
he got bitten by a squirrel

00:05:52.102 --> 00:05:53.311
and was left with a scar.

00:05:57.482 --> 00:05:58.900
Look who it is.

00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:00.819
Junsang?

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:03.905
That's how he earned the nickname.
Squirrel.

00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:06.324
The violent little squirrel.

00:06:07.993 --> 00:06:10.370
Looks like him, right?

00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:35.312
Hey, Miji.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:37.772
I'm looking into Kim's family
like you asked,

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:41.067
I came to see his father at his house.

00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:44.070
But they're packing up
like they're going on a trip.

00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:46.156
I see a lot of luggage.

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:48.742
And they're all getting in a van.

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:50.493
Something feels off.

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:52.329
There's these guys here helping them.

00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:55.206
But they don't seem like family.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.459
Someone's trying to cover this up.

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:00.545
- I can follow behind.
- No.

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:02.213
It's too dangerous.

00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:03.381
I got this.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.593
I was a divorce attorney's…
…right hand.

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:08.637
Comes with the territory.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.597
Let me know where they're going.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.351
And I'll see you there.
Don't get out until I arrive.

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:23.610
Last Sunday,

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:28.073
some members of the Catacomb
in the north visited your grandmother

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:31.534
and left her a bundle of rice,
bread and a letter.

00:07:32.327 --> 00:07:33.995
She seems healthy.

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:40.043
The letter says that you'll be there
the day after tomorrow

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:41.628
to take her to China.

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:45.715
She hung up a white shirt
as her signal back.

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:48.468
It means that she understands.

00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:52.597
You should go with her while you can.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.058
So today?

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:57.644
The situation is bad and getting worse.

00:07:57.727 --> 00:07:59.729
If you don't hurry, you might not make it.

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:03.149
What is this about, Father?

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:08.613
There was something that Mr. Jang
wanted me to do.

00:08:10.782 --> 00:08:14.786
I have been asking God
how I can uphold that agreement.

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:19.666
The church will fall into chaos soon.

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:23.545
What was it that Mr. Jung
had requested from you?

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:26.381
If it's somehow connected to the murder,

00:08:27.632 --> 00:08:29.592
you'll be in as much danger as he was.

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:31.177
Our promise.

00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:35.140
A promise that was made in the face of God
between myself and Junik.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:38.893
It's most important right now

00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:41.104
that you move your grandmother
out of the country.

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:44.524
If you don't do this,
you'll regret it your whole life.

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:51.322
It's something to do
with North Korea, isn't it?

00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:59.581
This is Saint Anthony.

00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:01.916
All this time, he's kept me safe.

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:21.352
Good evening.

00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:25.690
That's three adults and one child,
four total.

00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:27.984
One-way tickets to Melbourne, Australia
for tonight?

00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:29.152
Yes, that's correct.

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:31.654
One-way to Melbourne? But why?

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:36.868
Sorry to bother you.

00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:39.162
Mind if we ask you some questions?

00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:44.918
The person
you are trying to reach is not available--

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:51.966
Junsang.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:55.512
So Miss Miji Yeo,
where'd you come across a gem like her?

00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:56.930
She's a tough one.

00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:00.767
- Where are you?
- It was not an interrogation.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.144
I kept telling her I just wanted to talk.

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:06.439
But she claimed
you had nothing to with this

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:08.858
and insisted on her right to silence.

00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:10.443
Ah, shit.

00:10:12.821 --> 00:10:14.155
I said, "Where are you?"

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:18.243
I'm surprised.

00:10:19.661 --> 00:10:21.037
You're being quite rude.

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:26.835
When you come and pick up your friend,
let's see how far that gets you.

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:28.878
Okay?

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:37.428
What are you up to, Munju?

00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:40.223
I'm looking for answers about my husband.

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:42.142
Didn't you read the report?

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:45.228
The murderer was anti-reunification.

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:48.815
Why did you follow Junik?

00:10:56.447 --> 00:10:59.117
Are you implying
I had something to do with it?

00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:09.043
I expect this from other people,
but…

00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:11.462
…we're family, Munju, right?

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:15.800
Would you be interested to know
what I've actually done for Junik?

00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:17.218
What I've gone through for him?

00:11:18.428 --> 00:11:19.762
A reason?

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:23.683
That a prosecutor of this country…

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.562
had his brother tailed.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.735
He was a spy.

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:40.909
That's not true.

00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:42.577
You think I'd say this without proof?

00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:46.289
After they caught the shooter,
I assembled a special unit.

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:49.042
To cover it all up.

00:11:50.668 --> 00:11:52.170
All the evidence.

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:54.505
And everyone involved.

00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:57.258
Why?

00:11:57.342 --> 00:12:00.094
At any moment,
inter-Korean relations could change.

00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:06.684
What happens when a presidential candidate
is revealed to be a spy?

00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:09.145
Think of the damage that would do.

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:15.235
Or a plot from North Korea
could've been behind the murder.

00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:17.695
Then we're on the brink of war.

00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:21.908
And if the United States
has become involved,

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:25.912
the bond between our two nations
could be ruptured.

00:12:27.538 --> 00:12:28.957
Are you implying

00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:31.584
the US was involved with this?

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:42.262
We will meet again someday, won't we?

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:43.513
Mmm.

00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:49.394
Oh, right.

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:51.312
The wine is for you.

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:53.690
Don't forget to take it with you
when you get back.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:06.327
Father, would you mind
if I took this as well?

00:13:07.078 --> 00:13:08.454
I might need it.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.915
To find guidance in the darkness.

00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:19.757
My son, take care.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.510
Be safe out there, my young friend.

00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:27.098
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

00:13:27.181 --> 00:13:28.683
Amen.

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:43.656
HOLY BIBLE

00:14:01.632 --> 00:14:03.676
Attention, passengers,

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.680
boarding will soon begin for flight 1945
service to Dalian.

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:10.933
Boarding will close
ten minutes prior to departure.

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:12.810
Attention, passengers,

00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:14.854
boarding will soon begin for flight…

00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:16.939
Sanho Paik, an American.

00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:22.278
Top mercenary with Valkyrie,
the military contractor.

00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:24.781
Heard of him?

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:27.325
They'll protect or kill anybody.

00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:29.952
As long as the money's right.

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:31.537
No questions asked.

00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:40.546
People like me, first thing we do
is figure out escape routes.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:43.216
What exactly do you mean,
"people like you"?

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:46.260
Someone who doesn't have a country.

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:52.517
The man caught at the scene,
what do you think he was doing there?

00:14:55.937 --> 00:14:57.438
Just a little coincidence?

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:01.734
Do you see it now?

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:06.072
Do you understand why it has to be me?

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:09.367
For my family, my country,

00:15:10.284 --> 00:15:12.120
and even global peace,

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:14.288
I have to clean this all up.

00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:17.583
Just imagine

00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:19.794
if my mother

00:15:20.962 --> 00:15:25.383
discovered that her handsome, beloved,
and charming son was…

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:28.928
a spy for another country.
It'd be awful.

00:15:29.846 --> 00:15:32.014
Obviously, you envied Junik.

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:35.434
You were hoping he would fail
and you wanted to take his place.

00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:41.899
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

00:15:43.484 --> 00:15:44.861
Right.

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:47.113
Opportunity of a lifetime for you.

00:15:47.196 --> 00:15:50.700
The thing is, I know who my husband was.

00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:53.870
He may have been foolish at times

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:56.706
but he wasn't a spy.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.502
You say you have evidence,

00:16:03.337 --> 00:16:06.132
but I suspect that someone
went out of their way to fake this.

00:16:06.757 --> 00:16:08.551
Proof that frames an innocent man.

00:16:09.177 --> 00:16:10.469
That's your specialty.

00:16:11.846 --> 00:16:13.431
We decide who spies are.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.309
And what constitutes as evidence.

00:16:18.352 --> 00:16:20.563
It's just what we have to do
to protect out country.

00:16:22.648 --> 00:16:23.649
Really?

00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:25.234
How patriotic.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.030
The truth around Junik's death
will come out.

00:16:29.113 --> 00:16:31.073
I don't know about world peace,

00:16:31.157 --> 00:16:33.534
but I'll do what it takes
to find peace of my own.

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:46.047
I really did want to help
when you came to me.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.424
But you've left me with no choice.

00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:50.551
This is not my style.

00:16:51.636 --> 00:16:53.095
Miji…

00:16:55.097 --> 00:16:56.557
Oh, the blood?

00:16:56.641 --> 00:17:00.228
Let's just say biting a sitting prosecutor
will have its legal consequences.

00:17:02.772 --> 00:17:04.273
Well, I'm sure you deserved it.

00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:08.027
The two of you

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:12.240
should make arrangements
to leave Korea in 24 hours.

00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:15.368
Your Mrs. Yeo has older parents.

00:17:15.451 --> 00:17:17.036
I would hate for them

00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:20.706
to spend the rest of their lives
waiting for her return.

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:28.005
If Miji's okay, let me see her.

00:17:32.927 --> 00:17:36.472
Now's when you learn
about how we use real power

00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:39.058
to get someone
to act against their interests.

00:17:42.186 --> 00:17:43.896
It's really something to behold.

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:53.739
- Ms. Seo?
- I'm here, Miji.

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:55.950
Are you doing okay?

00:17:56.033 --> 00:17:58.578
Doing okay here. Sorry to worry you.

00:17:58.661 --> 00:18:01.414
Just keep thinking
about getting home to your parents.

00:18:01.497 --> 00:18:04.625
Stay focused on that. You'll be with them
within the next 24 hours.

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:06.961
Don't bow down
to these pieces of shit for me.

00:18:07.044 --> 00:18:08.963
All right, Ms. Seo? I'll be fine.

00:18:10.798 --> 00:18:12.341
Try and stay calm, okay?

00:18:13.384 --> 00:18:14.510
Just trust me.

00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:16.387
I'll have all taken care of by morning.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:17.930
I trust you, Ms. Seo.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.024
If you so much as lay a hand on Miji,

00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:29.525
I'll make sure you pay for it.

00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:30.610
How about

00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:33.696
we both keep our promises?

00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:58.429
Father Yang? It's Seo Munju.

00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:31.379
Father?

00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:39.053
Calm down.

00:19:40.721 --> 00:19:42.223
Keep quiet, okay?

00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:03.035
I was too late.

00:20:11.502 --> 00:20:13.754
- I'm calling the police.
- I need to get out of here first.

00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:17.133
Whoever did this
was looking for something.

00:21:50.226 --> 00:21:52.645
Who put you up to this?

00:21:52.728 --> 00:21:54.271
What were you looking for?

00:21:57.691 --> 00:22:01.028
The whale in the distant sea.

00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:07.785
Father Yang,
are you in there?

00:22:07.868 --> 00:22:09.537
What's going on?

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.080
Father Yang!

00:22:13.582 --> 00:22:14.583
Father Yang!

00:22:16.377 --> 00:22:18.045
Go get the key.

00:22:41.944 --> 00:22:43.404
Wait a minute.

00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:49.535
Someone out there will help you, Ms. Seo.

00:22:49.618 --> 00:22:51.120
Hang on.

00:22:53.247 --> 00:22:54.623
I gotta ask you something.

00:23:14.476 --> 00:23:17.813
We haven't used the tea room
since my husband passed away.

00:23:20.232 --> 00:23:24.194
Have you ever been here before,
by any chance?

00:23:24.278 --> 00:23:26.113
My first time actually.

00:23:26.739 --> 00:23:28.699
But I've definitely heard about it.

00:23:29.783 --> 00:23:33.454
The old men who were worried
about the country would gather here.

00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:39.585
Well, as I'm sure you've heard,
this room is safe to say anything in.

00:23:40.294 --> 00:23:42.171
The strictest security is in place.

00:23:43.464 --> 00:23:46.508
You know, I really put in a lot of effort
into getting you appointed

00:23:46.592 --> 00:23:47.927
to your position.

00:23:49.261 --> 00:23:50.763
And can I ask why, ma'am?

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:56.560
I wouldn't think of myself as very close
with you or the late minister.

00:24:02.858 --> 00:24:06.695
I've been a part of this circle
of military wives for quite a while.

00:24:08.614 --> 00:24:10.199
In those 40 years,

00:24:10.282 --> 00:24:14.495
I can't recall meeting anyone else
as gracious as your wife.

00:24:16.413 --> 00:24:18.832
When there's somebody as perfect as her,

00:24:20.334 --> 00:24:22.670
it says a lot about her husband.

00:24:25.631 --> 00:24:28.050
My wife is the one to thank
for me being here.

00:24:28.676 --> 00:24:30.511
She made sure I kept this appointment.

00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:35.182
She reminded me how terrible it would be
to abandon you in your time of need.

00:24:35.265 --> 00:24:36.850
Although beyond that,

00:24:36.934 --> 00:24:38.560
she refused to say why.

00:24:39.853 --> 00:24:41.188
Mr. Yu.

00:24:42.356 --> 00:24:43.941
Think back on your life.

00:24:44.525 --> 00:24:46.860
When were the challenges insurmountable?

00:24:50.572 --> 00:24:52.449
When my second child was ill.

00:24:53.492 --> 00:24:54.493
Mmm.

00:24:57.579 --> 00:24:59.164
We had a mystery donor.

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:02.292
Someone who covered the cost of surgery.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.588
I wish she hadn't told you.

00:25:07.214 --> 00:25:10.884
Keeping our spouses from worrying,
that's a wife's duty.

00:25:16.265 --> 00:25:17.933
Now, tell me, Mr. Yu.

00:25:18.017 --> 00:25:21.979
In the case of my dear son Junik,

00:25:22.771 --> 00:25:24.398
was the US involved?

00:25:27.317 --> 00:25:28.485
Can't be sure.

00:25:30.654 --> 00:25:31.989
But we've received intel.

00:25:32.781 --> 00:25:35.534
Anderson Miller,
an Assistant Secretary of State,

00:25:35.617 --> 00:25:37.161
is being sought by the US,

00:25:37.244 --> 00:25:38.746
the FBI to be precise,

00:25:39.329 --> 00:25:42.374
under suspicion of disclosing
classified government secrets.

00:25:43.667 --> 00:25:46.045
This Miller is wanted as a spy,

00:25:46.128 --> 00:25:48.630
and it sounds like Junik
was talking to him.

00:25:50.591 --> 00:25:52.968
There must be some kind
of misunderstanding.

00:25:53.052 --> 00:25:54.219
The truth is,

00:25:55.137 --> 00:25:58.724
in the months leading up to his death,
your son was being watched by us.

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:00.642
Why?

00:26:00.726 --> 00:26:02.311
Under suspicion of treason.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:07.649
We think he may have communicated
with the North from this very house.

00:26:11.737 --> 00:26:13.322
Absolutely absurd.

00:26:14.531 --> 00:26:15.574
Ms. Lim.

00:26:16.825 --> 00:26:18.827
There a bugs planted
throughout the mansion.

00:26:23.207 --> 00:26:26.502
Who's doing this? And why?

00:26:26.585 --> 00:26:28.837
Is the president trying to frame my son?

00:26:41.475 --> 00:26:42.893
Keep an eye out for this man.

00:26:46.146 --> 00:26:48.482
He's a private mercenary for Valkyrie.

00:26:48.565 --> 00:26:50.526
Those people will do anything for money.

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:52.528
We don't know what he's doing,

00:26:52.611 --> 00:26:54.947
we don't know why
he's approached your son,

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:56.490
or who brought him into this.

00:27:42.411 --> 00:27:43.912
What is this place?

00:27:43.996 --> 00:27:46.540
An underground tunnel
from the Japanese occupation.

00:27:53.338 --> 00:27:55.716
This network of churches
with underground tunnels

00:27:55.799 --> 00:27:58.468
connecting the North and South
is called the Catacombs.

00:27:59.219 --> 00:28:01.763
Only a handful of people,
including Father Yang and myself,

00:28:01.847 --> 00:28:03.265
know about them.

00:28:10.647 --> 00:28:13.567
I heard that you're a mercenary
for a private military group.

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:16.445
At Valkyrie, contracts are
renewed every one or two years.

00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:20.282
My contract was done a year ago,
and I chose not to renew it.

00:28:22.117 --> 00:28:25.537
You were the closest person to my husband
and Father Yang when they died.

00:28:26.079 --> 00:28:27.456
Is that a coincidence?

00:28:32.252 --> 00:28:34.588
This passage is 40 feet below ground.

00:28:35.881 --> 00:28:37.925
If you really thought I was dangerous…

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.721
then it's very curious
that you would follow me down here.

00:28:44.806 --> 00:28:46.975
I found this
in one of Father Yang's bibles.

00:28:53.148 --> 00:28:55.233
On the back of his hand, a puncture wound.

00:28:57.653 --> 00:28:59.237
He was poisoned to death.

00:28:59.988 --> 00:29:02.199
Ordinary people don't use those methods.

00:29:05.369 --> 00:29:07.955
The killer was looking
for something in his room, right?

00:29:08.038 --> 00:29:10.123
Father Yang said
that at mass tomorrow,

00:29:10.707 --> 00:29:13.710
he'd be relaying a message left with him
by Assemblyman Jang.

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.549
Junik had planned to announce something
at the end of mass that day.

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:38.694
SANHO, MARK

00:31:01.693 --> 00:31:02.819
That's Mayang Island.

00:31:04.446 --> 00:31:05.906
Youngpo Shipyard.

00:31:11.411 --> 00:31:17.417
{\an8}"Dear Junik, this is a satellite image
from DIA two weeks ago."

00:31:17.501 --> 00:31:21.505
This object is suspected to be
a 10,000-ton class nuclear submarine.

00:31:22.214 --> 00:31:25.175
We suspect that the object
is a 10,000-ton nuclear submarine,

00:31:25.258 --> 00:31:26.968
spanning 460 feet.

00:31:27.052 --> 00:31:30.514
It's equipped with 16 of the most
advanced vertical SLBM launch tubes,

00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:34.101
capable of holding 128 nuclear warheads.

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:36.394
If… If our analysis is correct,

00:31:36.478 --> 00:31:39.231
then the North Korean nuclear threat
is very real.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.193
Holy shit.

00:31:43.276 --> 00:31:45.445
- Yeah.
- Hey, fucktard!

00:31:45.529 --> 00:31:47.572
Weren't you the one
who insisted that the submarine

00:31:47.656 --> 00:31:50.659
the North Koreans were building
was a 3,000-ton rickety piece of junk?

00:31:50.742 --> 00:31:54.579
What if one day that venereal dipshit
says he's gonna nuke our country?

00:31:54.663 --> 00:31:57.165
What… What are you going to do then?
Fuck's sake.

00:31:57.249 --> 00:31:59.501
- Could you be any shittier at your job?
- Sir, I don't know what--

00:31:59.584 --> 00:32:00.794
- No, no, no.
- W-W-What I'm--

00:32:00.877 --> 00:32:03.213
Shut the fuck up! That was rhetorical.

00:32:04.131 --> 00:32:06.299
The news hit us like a ton of bricks.

00:32:10.428 --> 00:32:13.682
The submarine is expected
to be unveiled two months from now.

00:32:13.765 --> 00:32:16.518
In time for North Korean leader
Kim Hansang's birthday.

00:32:18.186 --> 00:32:20.814
Mr. President.
We're planning a precision strike

00:32:20.897 --> 00:32:24.734
with low-yield tactical nuclear weapons
on a total of 40 targets,

00:32:24.818 --> 00:32:28.572
including North Korea's
nuclear storage facilities, missile silos…

00:32:28.655 --> 00:32:32.409
US military is planning
to launch simultaneous precision strikes

00:32:32.492 --> 00:32:35.996
to wipe out all of North Korea's
military nuclear facilities.

00:32:36.079 --> 00:32:39.124
Our missile guidance system
has a strike record of over 98%.

00:32:39.207 --> 00:32:41.168
We're confident
we can destroy these targets.

00:32:49.593 --> 00:32:51.011
Excuse me, what…

00:32:52.637 --> 00:32:57.142
What about the possibility of a full-scale
escalation across the Korean peninsula?

00:32:57.893 --> 00:33:00.478
The Herman report suggests
there's a 32% chance

00:33:00.562 --> 00:33:02.564
that a preemptive strike
against North Korea

00:33:02.647 --> 00:33:04.524
could result in full-scale war,

00:33:04.608 --> 00:33:06.318
and while there's a 41% chance

00:33:06.401 --> 00:33:08.945
{\an8}that we could contain the conflict
to this region,

00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:10.280
{\an8}if it does escalate,

00:33:10.363 --> 00:33:13.366
{\an8}the entire East Asian region
will become a battlefield.

00:33:14.326 --> 00:33:15.994
Something isn't right here.

00:33:16.077 --> 00:33:19.873
The North Koreans don't have the capital
or the technology to pull this thing off.

00:33:19.956 --> 00:33:22.584
We could be putting
millions of lives at risk, sir.

00:33:22.667 --> 00:33:24.419
Let me just check to see
if this thing is real.

00:33:24.502 --> 00:33:27.088
I don't need you
to do shit, all right?

00:33:27.172 --> 00:33:28.757
This operation will be over
in five minutes.

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:31.593
I'm talking about
the warfare of the future,

00:33:31.676 --> 00:33:34.387
with the weapons of the future,
and the strategies of the future.

00:33:34.471 --> 00:33:36.765
And the history
of future warfare starts now.

00:33:38.266 --> 00:33:39.517
You know what?

00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:42.354
Stop trying to act like
you're being objective.

00:33:45.357 --> 00:33:47.692
You're barred from this room from now on.

00:33:47.776 --> 00:33:49.194
Presidential orders.

00:33:56.243 --> 00:33:57.410
Having a Korean face

00:33:57.494 --> 00:34:00.872
and advocating for the most
aggressive policies against Korea,

00:34:01.873 --> 00:34:03.708
that plays well in Washington.

00:34:05.168 --> 00:34:07.379
But this plan needs to be reconsidered.

00:34:08.463 --> 00:34:09.506
Help me, Junik.

00:34:11.716 --> 00:34:16.096
My phone, laptop, all my electronics…

00:34:17.222 --> 00:34:19.391
there might be eyes and ears
on all of them.

00:34:29.859 --> 00:34:33.738
Please reply via encrypted email
using the enclosed key,

00:34:33.822 --> 00:34:36.032
{\an8}and burn this letter once you've read it.

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:46.626
"Anderson Miller."

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:49.587
The US Assistant Secretary of State.

00:34:49.671 --> 00:34:53.091
My husband met him while they were
both getting doctorates at Georgetown.

00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:58.930
This must be what Junik
was planning to announce that day.

00:34:59.014 --> 00:35:00.473
He wanted to prevent a war.

00:35:02.142 --> 00:35:03.643
I have to get to North Korea soon.

00:35:03.727 --> 00:35:05.478
That's what Father Yang told me to do.

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.817
He knew a war could break out.

00:35:15.488 --> 00:35:17.240
You have family in the north?

00:35:24.623 --> 00:35:25.999
You should go.

00:35:26.666 --> 00:35:28.293
I'll take care of the letter.

00:35:29.502 --> 00:35:31.921
You'll be putting yourself
in a lot of danger.

00:35:32.797 --> 00:35:34.132
Are you ready for that?

00:35:38.678 --> 00:35:39.888
Yes.

00:35:58.323 --> 00:35:59.908
This is the only way.

00:35:59.991 --> 00:36:02.202
It's what my husband was planning to do.

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:04.954
You sure you can trust them?

00:36:06.331 --> 00:36:09.542
She's the most reliable
and powerful person in this country.

00:36:13.713 --> 00:36:15.423
You can leave now, Mr. Paik.

00:36:16.132 --> 00:36:17.592
I'll take it from here.

00:36:35.151 --> 00:36:37.696
He's the patron saint
for counter-revolutionaries.

00:36:39.614 --> 00:36:41.282
It's a gift from Father Yang.

00:36:43.243 --> 00:36:45.453
But I have miles to go
and should travel light.

00:37:02.429 --> 00:37:04.389
Yes, of course, sir. I understand.

00:37:04.472 --> 00:37:08.184
I realize she's not someone who
can just take a last-minute appointment.

00:37:08.268 --> 00:37:11.521
I know she's very busy,
but it doesn't have to be immediately.

00:37:11.604 --> 00:37:13.022
I just need a moment.

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:15.191
I'll be here.

00:37:15.275 --> 00:37:16.943
No, I'm not pressuring her.

00:37:17.026 --> 00:37:19.154
I have something urgent we--

00:37:42.427 --> 00:37:44.471
Why are you bothering my Chief of Staff?

00:37:44.554 --> 00:37:48.308
Sorry I did that, Madam President.
I know it's not protocol,

00:37:48.391 --> 00:37:50.393
but this news was too important to wait.

00:37:51.102 --> 00:37:52.562
The country could be at stake.

00:37:55.106 --> 00:37:58.693
US military is planning
to launch simultaneous precision strikes

00:37:58.777 --> 00:38:02.697
to wipe out all of North Korea's
military nuclear facilities.

00:38:02.781 --> 00:38:06.409
But this plan needs to be reconsidered.
Help me, Junik.

00:38:11.164 --> 00:38:14.375
I think that Junik was planning
to discuss this with you,

00:38:14.459 --> 00:38:16.294
to work together to find a solution.

00:38:16.878 --> 00:38:17.921
Mmm.

00:38:38.441 --> 00:38:41.528
Why didn't Assemblyman Jang
burn the letter after reading it?

00:38:41.986 --> 00:38:45.865
If he did,
Father Yang would be alive right now,

00:38:47.242 --> 00:38:50.245
and you wouldn't have to deal
with all of this mess, would you?

00:39:10.181 --> 00:39:12.642
For days after the Assemblyman's death,

00:39:12.725 --> 00:39:17.230
South Korean and American
intelligence agents were in turmoil.

00:39:18.773 --> 00:39:21.150
Once I began to understand the situation,

00:39:21.234 --> 00:39:23.820
I came to the same conclusion
as the Assemblyman.

00:39:23.903 --> 00:39:27.156
We have to prevent war at all costs.

00:39:29.367 --> 00:39:30.952
Which means you stay out of this.

00:39:33.079 --> 00:39:34.205
What?

00:39:35.164 --> 00:39:38.293
Diplomacy is done. This is war.
A game of chicken.

00:39:38.376 --> 00:39:41.671
Two men of debatable sanity
are speeding directly towards one another.

00:39:42.463 --> 00:39:44.883
They are both daring each other
to make the move.

00:39:46.217 --> 00:39:47.468
But they won't stop.

00:39:48.011 --> 00:39:52.015
We could be standing there, waving a flag
saying, "Peaceful solution, gentlemen."

00:39:52.599 --> 00:39:54.017
You think they'll listen?

00:39:56.477 --> 00:39:58.313
So what exactly is your plan?

00:39:58.396 --> 00:40:00.565
Next step is to pick a car to ride in

00:40:01.107 --> 00:40:03.276
and try to make them change directions.

00:40:04.861 --> 00:40:06.029
Munju.

00:40:08.948 --> 00:40:10.700
You know what your problem is?

00:40:11.534 --> 00:40:13.578
You are always too honest.

00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:17.081
For a diplomat, that's a disadvantage.

00:40:17.165 --> 00:40:18.333
As a smaller nation,

00:40:18.416 --> 00:40:21.127
when we were scrambling
for anything we could get

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:23.588
that type of charm had its uses, but…

00:40:24.672 --> 00:40:26.674
as a tool for standing up
to Hauser's regime,

00:40:26.758 --> 00:40:30.720
managing hostile, multilateral diplomacy,
you are absolutely hopeless.

00:40:31.763 --> 00:40:34.933
Do you really think
quitting was your choice?

00:40:35.433 --> 00:40:36.935
You were fired.

00:40:37.435 --> 00:40:38.937
In order to get results in this world,

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:42.023
one must use deception, betrayal,
scheming, lying and slander.

00:40:42.106 --> 00:40:43.858
So, we replaced you.

00:40:44.484 --> 00:40:45.693
Because you couldn't do it.

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:48.988
You see?

00:40:49.072 --> 00:40:52.075
Even now you can't believe
that I would betray you.

00:41:01.876 --> 00:41:03.086
Listen to me.

00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:06.547
Death and war isn't the same as murder.

00:41:07.465 --> 00:41:10.134
Your husband's tragic death
will get handled,

00:41:10.218 --> 00:41:12.804
but we'll handle it politically
and with strategy.

00:41:15.348 --> 00:41:17.892
So you know who killed him
and you're just covering it up.

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:21.270
The death of your husband
provides an opportunity

00:41:21.354 --> 00:41:23.481
to hitch a ride with the Americans.

00:41:24.983 --> 00:41:26.401
You should leave the country.

00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:28.319
You're interested
in nonprofit work, right?

00:41:28.403 --> 00:41:29.570
Just go.

00:41:29.654 --> 00:41:31.781
Doesn't matter where
as long as it's quick.

00:41:32.657 --> 00:41:35.368
And don't think of this as advice.

00:41:37.578 --> 00:41:38.746
This is an order.

00:41:39.998 --> 00:41:41.416
And what if I refuse?

00:41:41.499 --> 00:41:42.500
You won't.

00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:46.254
I'm responsible for preventing war
on the Korean peninsula.

00:41:47.672 --> 00:41:50.091
This is a lot bigger than any one person.

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:25.186
{\an8}DALIAN, CHINA

00:43:25.269 --> 00:43:28.189
{\an8}

00:44:05.017 --> 00:44:06.519
Pay up first.

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.201
Let's go.

00:44:43.973 --> 00:44:45.641
We found a new house.

00:44:45.725 --> 00:44:47.393
We'll all be out of here soon.

00:44:58.279 --> 00:44:59.947
I have to ask you, Mother.

00:45:00.573 --> 00:45:03.868
Why were you against
Junik and I getting married?

00:45:06.954 --> 00:45:09.707
You said you would cut him off
and never see him again.

00:45:16.464 --> 00:45:18.174
I wanted for my son

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:21.385
to marry someone warm, someone happy.

00:45:22.678 --> 00:45:24.305
But you're the opposite of that.

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:28.935
I thought he'd be unhappy,

00:45:30.102 --> 00:45:31.520
and then the worst happened.

00:45:32.605 --> 00:45:34.190
Finally we got your approval.

00:45:34.774 --> 00:45:36.609
I know we couldn't get married without it.

00:45:37.443 --> 00:45:40.780
On the outside, it may have looked like
Junik's father was in charge,

00:45:40.863 --> 00:45:43.366
but I know that you made
all the decisions.

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:56.087
Before the wedding,
I conducted a thorough background check.

00:45:56.879 --> 00:45:59.382
Your mother raised you alone in America.

00:45:59.966 --> 00:46:01.509
There's so much she went through…

00:46:02.802 --> 00:46:06.847
she worked at a nail salon,
as a hospital janitor, and a cashier…

00:46:06.931 --> 00:46:08.391
So many different jobs.

00:46:09.267 --> 00:46:10.434
When she got sick,

00:46:11.519 --> 00:46:14.105
Junik helped you take care of her
until she died.

00:46:18.276 --> 00:46:22.071
In college,
you made your model UN speech go viral,

00:46:22.154 --> 00:46:24.282
and I came across this article about you.

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:29.954
A young student with the Korean
national flag on her wall.

00:46:30.579 --> 00:46:33.165
Even in South Korea,
young patriots can be rare.

00:46:33.916 --> 00:46:36.377
I always wanted to be accepted
in my home country.

00:46:37.753 --> 00:46:38.921
For a long time,

00:46:39.797 --> 00:46:41.632
I dreamed of having a life in Korea.

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.467
And that is why

00:46:45.177 --> 00:46:47.263
we wanted Junik to go into politics.

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:50.433
Our family worked towards this
for generations.

00:46:50.516 --> 00:46:52.518
But there was always something he lacked.

00:46:53.519 --> 00:46:55.521
Something I could never give to him.

00:46:56.314 --> 00:46:57.398
And then,

00:46:58.441 --> 00:47:00.192
I realized it was patriotism.

00:47:01.652 --> 00:47:03.237
That's why I accepted you.

00:47:03.321 --> 00:47:07.867
I had to admit that you were exactly
the partner he needed. A good asset.

00:47:10.619 --> 00:47:11.871
Let me ask you something.

00:47:13.372 --> 00:47:14.749
Do you still think…

00:47:19.045 --> 00:47:21.047
that I should be the one
running for president

00:47:22.465 --> 00:47:23.716
instead of Junsang?

00:47:35.603 --> 00:47:38.689
Junsang was never likable,
not even as a child.

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:40.941
Junik was always the popular one.

00:47:41.734 --> 00:47:42.818
But you…

00:47:45.279 --> 00:47:46.489
You're something special.

00:47:47.448 --> 00:47:48.532
How can I put it?

00:47:50.451 --> 00:47:52.119
People are willing to back you.

00:47:52.203 --> 00:47:53.746
They feel safe with you

00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:55.581
and not because they want to win,

00:47:55.664 --> 00:47:58.000
but because they wouldn't mind
losing with you.

00:48:00.294 --> 00:48:02.338
If I were the party chair,
I would choose you.

00:48:03.255 --> 00:48:05.841
Certain traits can be worked on
with proper training,

00:48:05.925 --> 00:48:08.928
although some you have to be born with.

00:48:16.227 --> 00:48:19.563
Junik became a top presidential candidate
at such a young age.

00:48:20.398 --> 00:48:22.942
I'm aware of how much of that
was your work.

00:48:23.442 --> 00:48:25.778
His party, the media,
sponsors, the district…

00:48:26.362 --> 00:48:29.573
You must have spent decades
preparing everything for him.

00:48:35.996 --> 00:48:38.207
Why are you telling me
what I already know?

00:48:39.333 --> 00:48:41.335
I thought it must be painful for you.

00:48:42.253 --> 00:48:43.838
You laid out all these…

00:48:44.755 --> 00:48:46.507
intricate plans just to--

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:50.010
Come up short at the very end?
You assume I'm devastated.

00:48:51.303 --> 00:48:52.763
That's why I thought that

00:48:53.305 --> 00:48:55.349
if I offered my hand, you might take it.

00:48:55.933 --> 00:48:57.518
Even though you don't like me,

00:48:58.477 --> 00:49:01.480
I may be your only chance
to finish what you started.

00:49:19.665 --> 00:49:20.833
If my son…

00:49:22.251 --> 00:49:24.420
hadn't done what he did with his money,

00:49:25.463 --> 00:49:27.173
I could have felt sorry for you.

00:49:28.299 --> 00:49:30.885
I lost my child and you lost your husband.

00:49:31.552 --> 00:49:33.387
All women are different, but…

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.515
we are very much the same.

00:49:40.352 --> 00:49:43.481
I will take this
the rest of the way, Mother.

00:49:49.987 --> 00:49:50.988
{\an8}AMNOK RIVER, CHINESE BORDER

00:49:51.071 --> 00:49:52.490
{\an8}We won't make it today either.

00:49:52.573 --> 00:49:54.658
{\an8}I have to cross
the border today!

00:49:54.742 --> 00:49:56.494
You know my family's been waiting for me.

00:49:56.577 --> 00:49:59.330
Forget about them.
It doesn't matter if you're dead!

00:49:59.413 --> 00:50:01.707
River's blocked. You can't go any further.

00:50:03.751 --> 00:50:06.337
The Storm Corps has been all over here
the past few days.

00:50:11.133 --> 00:50:12.384
What is this?

00:50:12.468 --> 00:50:14.345
Just go.
This is how everyone else does it.

00:50:14.929 --> 00:50:16.347
{\an8}

00:50:17.515 --> 00:50:18.599
Run!

00:50:19.183 --> 00:50:20.226
Shoot them!

00:50:21.977 --> 00:50:23.354
In the water!

00:50:23.437 --> 00:50:25.981
Get in the water! Get them!

00:50:26.065 --> 00:50:27.483
Don't let them cross!

00:50:32.279 --> 00:50:33.864
Let's talk business, Munju.

00:50:35.282 --> 00:50:36.659
What do you want from me?

00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:40.579
And what do I get in return?

00:50:43.541 --> 00:50:47.253
I want you to put me in the presidential
race right where Junik left off.

00:50:49.547 --> 00:50:50.798
If I become a candidate…

00:50:52.925 --> 00:50:55.761
I will hand over the remainder
of Junik's assets.

00:50:57.096 --> 00:50:58.847
Including this house.

00:51:01.684 --> 00:51:03.352
AGREEMENT ON THE DIVISION
OF INHERITED PROPERTY

00:51:05.521 --> 00:51:07.481
So if I help you get the nomination,

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:11.527
you'll hand over everything,
even his overseas assets?

00:51:15.656 --> 00:51:18.117
If this were a novel,
the author would write,

00:51:18.742 --> 00:51:20.077
"She had been waiting…

00:51:22.329 --> 00:51:26.250
a long time for the day
when her husband would die,

00:51:26.959 --> 00:51:29.211
so she could reclaim
the dream she had lost."

00:51:37.386 --> 00:51:39.388
STUDENT RECORD

00:51:39.471 --> 00:51:40.973
Tell me what it says.

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:46.061
That used to be your dream.

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:51.066
PRESIDENT

00:51:56.155 --> 00:51:58.490
So, Munju. How should we begin?

00:51:59.742 --> 00:52:01.327
What would you like me to do first?

00:52:06.665 --> 00:52:08.000
I want you to call Junsang.

00:52:08.584 --> 00:52:11.837
Tell him to return my assistant.
Miji is to be sent home.

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.423
Junsang will withdraw his candidacy,

00:52:14.506 --> 00:52:16.342
and leave the country in 24 hours.

00:52:42.242 --> 00:52:44.411
I know you don't believe in God.

00:52:46.497 --> 00:52:50.542
You may utter prayers with your mouth,
but your soul doesn't truly rely on Him.

00:52:50.626 --> 00:52:53.337
You try to do everything by yourself.

00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:54.922
But, my dear boy,

00:52:55.005 --> 00:52:59.718
even if you never know God's love, you
can't go through life without human love.

00:52:59.802 --> 00:53:02.262
Who says that
I haven't experienced human love?

00:53:02.888 --> 00:53:08.060
Leaving home and going off to wander
the world is something we do to find love.

00:53:08.894 --> 00:53:11.522
But you're risking everything
to go back home.

00:53:17.861 --> 00:53:19.113
I'm going to stop this war.

00:53:19.863 --> 00:53:21.865
You'll be putting yourself
in a lot of danger.

00:53:23.242 --> 00:53:24.451
Are you ready for that?

00:53:27.454 --> 00:53:28.455
Yes.

00:54:08.245 --> 00:54:09.496
Tell the client…

00:54:13.417 --> 00:54:14.835
I'll take care of her.

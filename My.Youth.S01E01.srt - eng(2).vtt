(Song Joong Ki)

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.140
(Chun Woo Hee)

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.570
(Lee Joo Myung)

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.580
(Seo Ji Hun)

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.960
(my youth)

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.059
(Episode 1)

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.789
Hello.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.159
Yes, hello.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.399
Oh, I'm almost there. Yes.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.030
- Hello. - Hi there.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.070
Oh, ma'am. How much are the lisianthus today?

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.270
- Oh, are these the lisianthus? - Yes.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.639
- Seven dollars? - Yes.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.470
- Hey there. - Oh, you made it.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.490
Perfect.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.500
Oh, that's mine.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.069
Yes, thank you.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.810
Thank you. Have a good one.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.640
Thank you, ma'am. Thanks again.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.749
And the Best Actor Award goes to...

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.920
Sunwoo Hae for his role in "Ihwa, Wolbaek!"

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.220
At just 11 years old, he's our youngest winner ever!

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.880
Sir, please have a seat here.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.470
Yes, this is Sunwoo Hae.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.070
Who's calling?

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.440
Are you by any chance Sunwoo Hae, the former child actor?

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.769
Oh, no. Hold on a second.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.739
Sir, please, just hear me out.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.810
Here, let me try.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.210
Hello, this is the director, Jin So Ra...

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.450
He hung up?

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.890
He said no without even hearing the pitch.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.950
He's not picking up.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:06.820
Let's find him.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.490
This time, let's at least get our foot in the door.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.090
Here are the revisions for the show. Please review them.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.370
Yes, Assistant Director.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.900
How can you send us revised pages two hours before the shoot?

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.139
Are we the only ones getting these late again?

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.370
Takeout salad order is ready.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.040
Okay, see you on set.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.140
Okay!

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.520
Thank you.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.420
- Hi. - Hi.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.960
Thanks.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.460
I see in the revised pages he's wearing white again.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.359
A man who keeps wearing white...

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.030
in front of a woman traumatized by white.

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.339
Is this a romance or a thriller? A thriller, right?

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.670
He'll be like this until the final shoot. What can you do?

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.710
They say a leopard can't change its spots.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.840
Hey, don't smudge it.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.010
Thanks.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.510
He's such a jerk.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.700
Yes, I'm by the traffic light. Where are you?

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.930
Yes, I'm almost at the intersection.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.030
Where's the pickup?

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.330
Hey, I see you!

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:58.969
Okay.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.810
I'll just cross the street here and hop in.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.570
Yes. Hey.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.080
I got it!

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.640
Okay.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.679
- Oh my gosh! - Are you okay?

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.210
Hey, that car... It's just driving off!

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.450
- Are you okay? - Oh my gosh.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.019
- What do we do? - The booze...

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.219
- Here. - My booze...

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.950
- Let's go to the hospital. - The hospital?

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.660
Gosh, that totally sobered me up.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.490
I said you should go to the hospital first!

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.330
You okay?

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.630
Wait here.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.270
- Great work today. - Great work.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.040
Great work, everyone.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:41.669
- Tae Rin. - Yes?

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:42.869
Go on ahead to the car.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.710
I'll finish up, then we can go.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:45.980
- All right. - Okay.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.180
Excuse me, Manager Yang?

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.220
Do you have a second?

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.820
Hey! Are you nuts?

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.259
You crazy punk! Who do you think you are?!

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.030
- Get out while I'm being nice. - What?

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.200
What... You jerk. You just wait!

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.340
You'll stop being nice, and then what?

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.570
What'll you do, you punk?

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.480
Excuse me, but I'd appreciate it if you'd obey the traffic laws.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.480
Who is this disrespectful punk?

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.050
What? Hey, did you just dodge that?

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:23.780
Oh, you punk. Okay, fine.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.250
Don't dodge again, you punk. You got it?

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:27.720
This darn punk.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:28.790
Hey, you jerk!

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.720
Darn it!

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:36.590
Excuse me, sir.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.060
Do you want to come with me to the police station...

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.900
or are you going to go apologise?

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.170
I was hoping you'd do both, actually.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.280
Let it go? What are you talking about?

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.610
That's exactly why you're always getting taken advantage of.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.520
That's liquor we can't even replace.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.420
This is Seok Joo's car. Should you drive it like this?

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:06.960
Does Seok Joo even know about this?

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.630
That's what you're worried about?

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.130
Anyway...

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.070
Open the shop a little early today.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.069
We have to make up for the lost liquor.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.270
You penny-pincher.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.139
Be honest. You did it for the money, right?

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.210
Oh, come on now.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.440
How could you suggest such a...

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:27.310
blatantly obvious thing?

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:32.150
The wardrobe team said they prepared a black outfit, as the script said.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.780
You have to stick to the script.

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:36.490
But the writer changed it to a white outfit.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.689
This is the best sequence in the entire episode,

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.690
and if we nail it, it'll make the main characters pop.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.229
All because your actor had to look nice,

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:45.529
this will ruin everything.

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:47.499
Gosh, to hear you talk,

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.800
you'd think Mo Tae Rin was the main character.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.099
But she's just a package-deal actor.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.369
Hey, for a month, that outfit was black,

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.439
and now, all of a sudden, it's white today.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.840
And it's a scene with direct continuity.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.480
How can his clothes be white mid-scene?

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.310
I'm not the only one bothered by this.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:03.879
Is the writer insane?

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.220
- Hey! - What?

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.789
He said he wanted curry,

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.989
so I have to go buy it. Do you have to do this now?

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.160
Don't change the subject.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.290
Is this a conversation about curry?

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:17.530
Hang on a second.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.700
Oh, is the curry ready?

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:21.970
Yes, I'm on my way.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.370
Hey, Je Yeon.

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.209
The assistant director, script supervisor, and floor director...

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.040
have all been tormenting me.

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.510
But what can I do? He's refusing to budge.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.349
I'm at my wit's end here.

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:36.249
And I'm the one getting all the heat.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:37.980
What am I supposed to do?

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.520
You could at least pretend to try and convince him.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:46.490
Anyway, I'm leaving.

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:49.730
That curry...

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:54.229
One little bump of the elbow... That should do the trick.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.400
Oh, no, forget it.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.240
- I'm leaving. - Go.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:09:59.740
Bye.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.080
Bump.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.380
Spill curry on the shirt.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.050
Spill it.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.389
Head!

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:21.730
Waist!

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.730
Head! Waist!

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:27.700
Curry!

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.629
Head!

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.939
On the shirt! The curry!

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.110
On the shirt! The curry!

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:36.469
Spill it! Get it everywhere!

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.939
On your clothes! Curry!

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.850
Spill it! Get it everywhere! On your clothes!

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.680
I love curry

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:46.949
Curry.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:48.989
Gosh, this is so good.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.620
Gosh, curry

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:54.930
Hey!

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:57.559
- Yes? - I'm wearing white!

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.029
Oh, sorry. I just...

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:00.100
Be careful.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:10.210
Gosh.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.540
Gosh, this shirt...

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.550
This is the only white shirt. This...

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:17.420
I'm going to head out now.

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:19.880
See you, Sung Je Yeon.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.719
Aren't you two leaving?

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.749
Nam Jun ho put on his original outfit...

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:24.889
because his costume isn't ready.

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.260
He spilled curry on his shirt.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.160
What's this?

00:11:33.161 --> 00:11:35.669
Je Yeon, my meeting is running late again today.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:37.770
Looks like I can't make it. Sorry.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.410
Finally off work!

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:50.850
Don't you ever sleep?

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:52.980
It's 3am.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.520
Gosh, you waited up for me all this time?

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:59.260
You know Producer Yu Je Il's show?

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:03.090
Even a guest spot would be amazing. Can't you work something out?

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.800
I heard the CEO brought it up today, too.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:09.600
I was going to get a head start on it.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:13.040
Je Il is busy trying to find some novelist right now.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.810
You should probably read up on that author, just in case.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:18.810
The way he keeps bringing him up, he must be a huge fan.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.780
What's the novelist's name?

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.310
Jin Mu Yeong.

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.220
Oh, I read his books in college.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.579
It was so refreshing, it totally blew my mind.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.720
Okay, got it.

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:29.220
So...

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:32.220
About your pilot...

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.260
Is there really no spot for Tae Rin?

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:36.430
You...

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:38.030
Do you pull this every quarter?

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.200
What, you think I owe you?

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.729
Do you know what it's like not to find who you need?

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:44.200
Who are you so desperate to find this time?

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:45.700
I can help.

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:47.169
If we're going with Mo Tae Rin...

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.470
the only option is the scrapped show, pairing her with Sunwoo Hae.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.010
That project...

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.680
You're still hung up on that?

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.380
Je Yeon.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.580
How about you do the legwork and find Sunwoo Hae for me?

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.850
If you do, I'll set up a meeting with Je Il for you.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.920
Really?

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.990
You promise?

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:12.830
Buying flowers for someone?

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.639
I don't know why getting dumped at my age...

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.440
has me grinding my teeth like this.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:21.540
What?

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.070
I see.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.479
One day, I cried my eyes out.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.149
The next day, I cursed him.

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:29.380
And in the end,

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:31.050
I just missed him, I think.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.520
You still remember that?

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.949
Just forget about it, will you?

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:37.450
I had just turned 20, and it was my 1st time drinking.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:39.260
Seeing you cry?

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.290
It was quite a spectacle.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.030
But why bring up Sunwoo Hae now?

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:48.730
Right.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.240
It's about that project that was scrapped last year.

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:52.700
Is it back on the table?

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.139
No, not yet.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.340
I don't know for sure yet.

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:57.809
Someone posted this on my feed a while back.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:59.540
The more I look, the more sure I am.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.010
It feels weird to just show up, though.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:04.920
I said some harsh things to him in high school.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.519
He was just trying to make it, and I treated him like dirt.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.120
Just pretend you're not you.

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:10.820
Go in a disguise.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:12.760
How about a fake moustache?

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:13.960
That's ridiculous.

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:17.390
No, what if I just go check the shop and come back?

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.400
So Ra can handle the casting offer.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:20.999
Let's just say you go over there.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.699
And it's really him.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:23.800
You think he'll agree?

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:25.600
If I were him, I wouldn't.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.640
And not just because of your history.

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.570
You know what I mean.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.240
He'd probably be reluctant.

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:35.579
Given everything that happened.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:39.120
But wait, you treated him like dirt?

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.790
So, if he says no this time, it'll be your fault.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:44.150
Me?

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.860
Don't you act like you know me again!

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:51.330
Ever!

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:32.470
I wonder if they're open.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.210
(Start of Spring)

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:51.190
Excuse me.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:09.570
Welcome.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:18.940
I guess I should probably buy a plant.

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:22.980
I see.

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:26.480
If you want to buy one,

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.490
then I guess you should buy one.

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:31.820
Right?

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.130
Come on in.

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:53.340
What? He has no idea who I am.

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:22.370
Well...

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:26.340
So, you're looking for a houseplant?

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:27.740
Well...

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:29.980
I guess so? The kind that's...

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:32.150
easy to take care of.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.590
You know, the kind that basically takes care of itself.

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:35.690
I see.

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:48.730
Sung Je Yeon.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.780
So, am I still...

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:04.520
supposed to act like I don't know you?

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.950
Well...

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:14.590
What?

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.400
Is that a yes or a no?

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:31.810
It's good to see you.

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.410
How have you been?

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.220
Well...

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:45.890
You know Mo Tae Rin, right?

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.430
I'm her manager. We're here about a casting offer.

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:51.060
Never heard of her.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.300
How can you not know our Tae Rin?

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:56.970
Sir.

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.849
You two were a huge sensation as the National Siblings.

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:16.020
And you even went to the same high school.

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:17.490
Oh, I see.

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:19.820
Don't tell me you're using the "classmates" excuse...

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:22.090
to try and get me on some show.

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:27.729
There's a director looking for you for a project about your old sitcom.

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:29.899
They want to feature both you and Mo Tae Rin...

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:34.170
to evoke nostalgia for that era, while showing your current lives.

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:43.380
If you appear on the show, it'll be good exposure for the store.

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:47.520
A National Sibling reunion. It'd be so touching.

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:52.489
People will be curious to see how Sunwoo Hae turned out.

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:53.820
They'll want to see you.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.400
I can imagine why you're reluctant.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.909
But it's a solid idea. Please look it over.

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:11.710
And what reason do you think that is?

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.080
So how much does it pay to appear on the show?

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:18.980
The admission fee.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.190
I'm curious what price you've put on me.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.820
That expression is...

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.259
Look, we're not going to...

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.990
lock you in a cage and start filming.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.699
For a past so brief,

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.100
I won't go on the show and be in Mo Tae Rin's debt.

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:40.740
You want me to sell memories to strangers?

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.240
To put my unexciting life on display?

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:47.880
Right, well, I can see how it might've come off that way.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.580
But isn't that a bit of a stretch?

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:52.720
You seem pretty offended.

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.950
As much as I'd love to say yes to the show,

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.550
let's just say I'm too busy making a living.

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.420
Hey, by any chance...

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.400
Is this because I treated you like dirt in high school?

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:10.770
If I hurt your feelings, I'm sorry.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:12.800
I'll apologise.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:13.900
You...

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:17.240
treated me like I was dirt?

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.620
I can't believe this guy.

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:41.600
Come on, just help me out this one time.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.300
What are old classmates for, anyway?

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.470
Will this planter work?

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.150
Please say yes.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.620
Is that a no?

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.450
How are you getting around?

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:08.020
We use a car.

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:12.160
I won't charge you for it.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.200
Since you came all this way for nothing.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.500
Don't get so chummy with me.

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:20.840
Were you curious to see too?

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:30.180
How I turned out?

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:51.070
I understand your refusal perfectly.

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:53.370
Goodbye.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:17.459
Darn, I should've pretended I knew him to get the upper hand.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.760
- Yes? - He threw me off my game.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.230
Hey, can you hear me? Who are you talking to?

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.299
No, now that I think about it,

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.199
I really don't think I was...

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.840
that harsh to him back in the day.

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:29.339
What's this all of a sudden?

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.210
I'm so exhausted.

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:35.080
I just met with Sunwoo Hae.

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.580
- What? - He said no. He won't do the show.

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:39.350
Hey!

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:40.920
You went behind my back...

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:43.090
No, I wanted to meet him...

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:44.960
Where did you meet him?

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:47.889
Giving out info on someone who said no...

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:49.259
I'm not comfortable doing that.

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:50.290
Sung Je Yeon.

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:52.460
Are you messing with me?

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:56.070
- He seemed pretty adamant... - Where are you, Sung Je Yeon?

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.640
Why are you yelling at me?

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.810
Because of you, I'm the one who's completely humiliated here!

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:08.480
I'm not yelling because I'm mad. I'm just so upset, okay?

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:12.780
("The Unknown Sanitation Worker")

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.489
Ma'am, you haven't even had dinner.

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:20.990
It's fine. I have dinner plans.

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:22.090
You're back?

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:23.760
How was your meeting?

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:26.030
A book? Reviewing the source material? Is it any good?

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.130
Jin Mu Yeong?

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:31.200
I heard Producer Yoo Je Il is dead set on finding him.

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:33.140
He's telling the whole world.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.500
Yes, that's right.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.270
I thought I should read up on it to have something to talk about.

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:40.679
But the name sounds familiar. I don't even read novels.

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.310
How hard can it be to find one novelist?

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:44.310
Yes, this is Kim Pil Du speaking.

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.119
I checked with the publisher,

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:51.020
and it seems he's hired a proxy and is intentionally laying low.

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:55.729
What?

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:57.290
Oh, my gosh. You gave me a heart attack.

00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:58.829
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:00.730
Director, here. The heart's on the left.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.670
Wait, I...

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:05.770
I'm leaving for the day. There's something I need to check.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.200
I'll be going now. Sorry.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.210
(Handle with Caution)

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:24.890
(To Sunwoo Hae, Sung Je Yeon)

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:32.829
("Waegeum" by Jin Mu Yeong)

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:35.130
(To Sung Je Yeon, Sunwoo Hae)

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:38.840
Oh, that's it!

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.640
Darn it.

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.080
What's this?

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:46.580
It's a wish bracelet.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.580
I bought it for you.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.320
But why do you still have that?

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:06.100
One freebie.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:12.200
Cactus.

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:44.700
The problem with coincidence is that it's always sudden.

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:47.870
Why doesn't real life come with a trailer?

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:56.250
Did you see the message board?

00:27:56.950 --> 00:28:00.049
Everyone's going wild asking who that listener was who read.

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:02.220
Saying how amazing my junior's voice is.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.530
"Just one little pebble fell out,"

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.230
"but everything came pouring out."

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:21.340
"In his name, too much rain fell."

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:23.170
"Perhaps he was born under a cold star."

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:27.180
"He hoped all my days would be sunny."

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:30.510
"The smiling face that said his life had been nothing but rain..."

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:32.950
"is something I can't quite recall."

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.550
"The reason I borrowed his name to create a garden..."

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:39.190
"was to tell him..."

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.990
"that rain only falls to bring clear skies."

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:44.360
"That was the message I wanted to send."

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:47.030
"That's when I realised."

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:49.399
Gosh, what a voice.

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.670
"Today's Voice."

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:54.500
It's a segment where we invite a listener to read from a book.

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:56.610
"Today's Voice?"

00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:59.639
"That I had forgotten I'd forgotten all about him."

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.210
I think that's him.

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:03.450
Yes.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.320
Oh, yes, I just got another call.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.650
Okay, I'll see you in a bit. Yes.

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:12.390
Yes, hello?

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.919
Hi, I'm in the lobby, and I can't get past security.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.189
Okay, and where are you from?

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:17.259
I told you, the lobby.

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:19.260
No, I mean, who sent you?

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:21.259
Flowers from Ms. Bang Han Na.

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:23.530
Oh, okay. I'll be right down.

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:25.340
Hey.

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:28.140
The director sent flowers for your radio debut.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.210
I'll go get them.

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:31.170
- I'll head inside first, then. - Okay. Over there.

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:34.640
"If..."

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:37.380
"you were to exist in another world,"

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:40.080
"I hope you'll understand my deepest wish."

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.390
"That where you are..."

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:46.520
"is forever clear and bright."

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:50.530
"That was my small hope and faith."

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.999
This has been "A Beautiful Morning."

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.670
and "Today's Voice."

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:00.339
We'll be back for Part Four after some music.

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:02.670
Our guest will be actress Mo Tae Rin.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.150
Hey.

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:18.790
Tae Rin, why are you crying?

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:22.330
Are you nervous about your radio debut?

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:24.730
Why did that suddenly come to mind?

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.630
I'm not sure.

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:35.740
It's okay, all right?

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:39.140
Great job, everyone.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.409
- Hey. - Yes?

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:41.410
I'm heading home.

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.980
How annoying.

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.710
This is seriously ticking me off.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.480
Get lost.

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:48.749
Call me again next time if a listener flakes on you.

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:49.820
If you buy me a drink.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.130
Hello.

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:57.490
Hello.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:30:59.929
I'll get going now.

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:01.600
- Good work. - Goodbye.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.340
Were you crying?

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:11.010
Yes.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.740
I wonder why you cried.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.640
Why are you smiling?

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:17.410
Because you're pretty?

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.820
Oh, I get it now.

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:26.320
This time, you were funny.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:27.560
Don't you...

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.329
recognise me?

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:31.030
Who doesn't know Mo Tae Rin?

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:35.229
Yes, this is Kim Seok Joo.

00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:37.200
See? It is Kim Seok Joo.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.170
So do you know me or not?

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:56.690
Hello.

00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:00.560
I got a call to come down.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.790
You can just give that to me.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.160
Is this a coincidence?

00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:06.960
Why are you talking to me so casually?

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.500
Are you pretending you don't know me again?

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:12.000
Because I turned down your offer?

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:13.400
That's not it at all.

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:17.009
Why the smile?

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:18.010
Because I'm happy to see you.

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.680
I'll take your picture with the flowers.

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:24.409
A picture? Why?

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:26.579
It's proof of delivery for Bang Han Na.

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:27.680
All right, here I go.

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:30.820
Do you still have feelings for him?

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:33.819
Are you out of your mind?

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:35.830
Oh, I think we need a retake.

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:37.060
No.

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:39.600
I'll let her know that I got them.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.400
Please delete the picture with him in it.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:43.600
Thank you.

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:49.240
So what's the deal with you two?

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:52.340
You're here delivering flowers?

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:54.410
What else? To make my debut?

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.550
If you had another chance to debut, would you do it?

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:00.750
Have you two kept in touch since graduation?

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.320
Or...

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.189
did she study abroad like you?

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:05.760
She couldn't. Her family went broke.

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:08.460
Should I send you a flower basket when you make your debut?

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:10.130
Then buy the flowers from my shop.

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:11.630
What? Where are you going?

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.030
Off to your debut?

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:14.800
You got this! Go for it!

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:21.870
The cactus.

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:23.040
The cactus?

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.110
What about the cactus?

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:29.710
The one I gave you.

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:32.050
You killed it already?

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.380
Oh, and here I was thinking...

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.120
you'd finally decided to join the show.

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:39.590
Is that all you wanted?

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:47.160
Well...

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:54.140
You got my number earlier, right? Give me a call.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.240
And why would I do that?

00:33:55.241 --> 00:33:56.670
For any number of reasons.

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:58.980
Like if something happens to the cactus,

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.210
or if you get hungry.

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:11.750
What?

00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:20.460
So that's what you were up to.

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.100
What is this?

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:25.470
Water in a paper cup.

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.140
Just give it this much water once a month.

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.610
Just use your words. It's faster.

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:32.640
Doodling at your age...

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:33.810
To stall for time.

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:37.450
What are you trying to pull?

00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:47.490
Hoo.

00:34:49.390 --> 00:34:50.390
'Hoo?"

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:54.960
"Hoo?"

00:34:55.870 --> 00:34:56.870
Hoo!

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:58.630
"Hoo?"

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:01.640
I see.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.540
To get better?

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:07.910
You still do that?

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.850
- Thank you. - Don't mention it.

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:22.160
- Je Yeon. - Yes?

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:24.590
Someone smiled at me earlier.

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:27.430
I wonder why. Was I looking especially pretty today?

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:28.530
Hey!

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:29.870
Yes?

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:33.200
Who wouldn't smile at you? Unless they had a screw loose.

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.040
Wait a second.

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:38.170
Have you been crying?

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.410
Your eyes are red.

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.680
It's nothing.

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.010
I just got a little misty-eyed thinking about the past.

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:48.150
What were you thinking about?

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:50.050
Well...

00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:53.190
About wanting to die.

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:55.530
What?

00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:57.760
Oh, I'm kidding.

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:00.600
- Got a lot on your mind? - No, I don't.

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:02.730
That settles it. We're hiking tomorrow.

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:03.930
- I don't want to. - You're coming.

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:06.300
- I don't want to! - We're going, Mo Tae Rin.

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:14.880
Je Yeon, my meeting's running late. I don't think I can make it today.

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:19.320
That's perfectly fine, Assistant Director.

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:21.320
Just let me know when you're free again.

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:37.270
Hello, Producer Yu.

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:40.840
I'm Mo Tae Rin's manager.

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:43.170
I see.

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:46.010
We actually went to the same university.

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:47.240
Seoul National University, Business.

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:48.580
I was in political science, actually.

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:51.280
A manager from SNU. Well, that's a first.

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:56.850
I heard you're a fan of Jin Mu Yeong's novels.

00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:00.490
We went to the same school, so I was pleased.

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.160
We went to the same high school, you see.

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:06.630
I see.

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:09.700
Are you close? You still keep in touch?

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:11.270
Yes, you could say that.

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:12.869
As it happens,

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:14.400
things are that way.

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:19.040
Could you set up a meeting?

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:21.480
After all, it's better than a total stranger.

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:25.010
There's a special bond between alumni.

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:26.950
Exactly. Of course.

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:29.220
A special bond...

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:31.190
Do we have one?

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:33.990
Am I fond of him?

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:40.400
Why the smile?

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:43.700
Because I'm happy to see you.

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:50.410
It seems...

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:53.180
that way.

00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:57.080
If you're done, get out of here.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:59.080
How long are you going to space out?

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.149
I'm just going to be shameless.

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:05.220
And use this to my advantage, Director.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:06.690
Lights out.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.730
I need a better performance record so I can get a raise...

00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:12.700
He actually turned them off.

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:19.840
- I'm actually feeling up for it. - Feeling good, are you?

00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:21.840
Are you sure you'll be okay?

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.740
Get some fresh air.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:25.840
Feels great, doesn't it?

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:30.080
Taerin, look over here.

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.180
Gosh, it's hot.

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:33.250
Thanks.

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:39.520
I'm so glad we came out.

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.020
I know, right?

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:50.430
So what's this about Jin Mu Yeong?

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.140
He's our ticket to a meeting with Producer Yu Je Il.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.600
So now it's Yu Je Il.

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:57.040
So you failed to land Sunwoo Hae?

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.479
Look, I've summarized all of his novels for you,

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:01.679
so make sure you're familiar.

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:04.650
Then bring them up naturally at the meeting. Okay?

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:07.320
You need to have some common ground for conversation.

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:09.919
Right, as if Producer Yu would ever cast me.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.250
All the A-listers are lining up to work with him.

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:15.620
For his shows, even a one-off role is a huge deal.

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.430
A weekly spot would be better.

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:20.300
You're just setting yourself up for disappointment.

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:24.430
Let's just head down and get something good to eat.

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:26.969
All right.

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:28.800
Gosh, that looks delicious.

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.949
Some makgeolli...

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:40.119
Think we can order some?

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:42.179
But makgeolli is just a bunch of carbs.

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:44.120
And it's so sweet and delicious, isn't it?

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:45.450
Go ahead, order it.

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:48.860
I'll pass.

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:51.889
I'll skip the dip and make lettuce wraps.

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:53.660
And I'll stick to the lean meat.

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:01.700
Tae Rin.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.970
You don't want to do variety shows, do you?

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:05.440
It's just...

00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:08.710
I'm not confident about showing my true self.

00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:09.880
I'm not even funny.

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:12.520
You are funny. Don't worry.

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:16.650
There's nothing like those shows for boosting your public profile.

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:21.520
But I don't want to force you to do something you hate.

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.990
You sound just like my mom.

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.659
Always making me do what I hate for my own good.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:28.130
I don't remember having a daughter like you.

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.500
So harsh, Mom.

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:33.240
So, all that's left now is...

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:36.340
to get Jin Mu Yeong in front of Producer Yu.

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:38.509
Jin Mu Yeong, was it?

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:40.310
What if you just cry in front of him?

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:42.480
When I was a kid, crying got me anything I wanted.

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:44.810
Are you really going to give me such a flippant answer?

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.320
But...

00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:49.590
Do you think it'll work even if I'm 34?

00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:51.490
Oh, they'll give in,

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:54.920
just not in the way you think.

00:40:57.690 --> 00:40:58.990
Is there really no way?

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:04.429
The person you have reached is unavailable.

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:06.440
Why isn't he picking up?

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:10.970
(Sunwoo Hae)

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:13.910
Gosh! You startled me.

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.210
What? Why are you here?

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:20.450
I guess you're too low-level to be told about unofficial changes.

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:22.889
What were you again? A grunt?

00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:23.890
Team Leader.

00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:25.649
Since when do you just waltz in?

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:26.760
As of today.

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.760
The economy's rough, so I'm moonlighting.

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:30.290
Very funny.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:35.899
You're not inheriting this company, are you?

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:38.070
Like, this isn't some kind of management training, is it?

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:40.799
Why don't you ever think I might be here to debut?

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:43.070
That's funny. Are you a comedian?

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:46.280
Hello, ma'am.

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:50.310
Why is Seok Joo here?

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:52.720
I thought it was time he started learning the ropes.

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:56.290
If my son becomes your boss, will you resign?

00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:59.220
Don't go anywhere, ma'am.

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:02.160
Oh, and what about Producer Yu?

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:04.430
Did you pull strings with your SNU connection?

00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:07.300
Well, technically, I dropped out.

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.500
But I did pull strings.

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.630
That's why you went to SNU.

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:15.170
Get home safe.

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:21.439
So, can I hope for a regular spot on a variety show?

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.150
Especially if it's Yu Je Il.

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:24.980
I'll work hard to make it happen.

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:29.620
Yes, Producer.

00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:31.290
Hello, this is Yu Je Il.

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:33.020
Have you set a date yet?

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:37.430
It's just that my daughter has to study for exams next week.

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:41.330
Oh, so your daughter's a fan too?

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.030
So your daughter's a fan.

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:46.140
Right, I see.

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.600
I'll set a date and let you know.

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:54.610
What if he doesn't take private calls?

00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:57.710
I'm seriously going to hunt you down if you don't pick up.

00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:00.280
(Start of Spring)

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:15.300
Gosh, why does he keep putting these on backwards?

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:22.000
- Hey. - Hey.

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:24.069
They'd like to add some flowers inside.

00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:25.410
Oh, hello.

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:27.680
You can discuss it with him.

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.410
- Good luck with that. - Okay.

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:33.819
So you want fresh flowers for the cafe?

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:35.050
- Yes. - I see.

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:38.520
If you're set on having flowers, have you considered preserved ones?

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:40.660
They have the look and feel of real flowers.

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:42.559
"Preserved?" What's that?

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:43.760
Well, they're...

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:45.490
Here comes the sales pitch again.

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:47.859
He's unbelievable...

00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:49.369
- One moment, I'll show you. - Okay.

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:51.630
Usually, people go with hydrangeas...

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:53.769
or roses.

00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:55.440
See? They look just like real...

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.369
- One moment, sorry. - Sure.

00:43:57.370 --> 00:43:58.510
Just one second.

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:01.840
Yes, hello?

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:04.710
Finally, you answer.

00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:07.420
Where are you?

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:12.190
(Taxi)

00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:34.679
You tell me to call you, but then you don't pick up.

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.250
That's not really fair, is it?

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:38.280
Why?

00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:39.980
Is there a problem with the cactus?

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:44.790
Seeing as you're empty-handed, I guess it's not about that.

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:46.390
Are you hungry, then?

00:44:46.391 --> 00:44:49.430
What kind of person do you take me for?

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:51.760
The kind who only appears for a favour?

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:03.169
(To Sung Je Yeon, Sunwoo Hae)

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:04.570
What?

00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:08.110
"Jin Mu Yeong."

00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:10.510
How could I have forgotten all about this?

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:12.579
You've kept that all this time?

00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:14.820
I paid for it. I couldn't just throw it away.

00:45:15.350 --> 00:45:17.150
The bookstore I bought this at closed down.

00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:18.450
It's gone? That bookstore?

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:22.160
And this book's publisher supposedly went bankrupt.

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:23.260
Oh, they did?

00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:25.629
And it's out of print, so they're not making any more.

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:26.700
Right, no more.

00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:28.700
So what's your point?

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.330
A novel like that...

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:31.430
still has...

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:34.500
a fan. A high school student, of all people.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.010
Isn't that just so impressive and heartwarming?

00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:40.640
Just this once.

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:42.850
Would you meet her?

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:44.510
A high school student?

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:47.150
Do I have to get on my knees and beg?

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:48.280
Yes.

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:49.490
Go ahead. Give it a shot.

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:52.120
It's just an expression.

00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:56.190
It's not for a TV appearance. She's just a fan.

00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:59.230
Is that too much to ask?

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:07.640
Fine, whatever. I'll meet her.

00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:13.210
Just like that?

00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:14.910
What, you want me to play hard to get?

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.580
No, easy is great.

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:18.750
You're working so hard.

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:24.690
Here, let me help you.

00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:25.920
So we just need to move this?

00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:28.360
It's pretty heavy, though.

00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:30.760
I'm stronger than I look. I'm serious.

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:32.690
Besides, you hurt your hand.

00:46:36.370 --> 00:46:37.400
All right, fine.

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:38.830
- On three. - Got it.

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:40.940
Okay. One, two!

00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:04.730
Why are you grabbing me?

00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:07.600
What are you talking about?

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:10.300
No, I mean...

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:14.640
We were supposed to lift on 3. What should I do if you lift on 2?

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:15.770
Well...

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:18.310
I was just startled, that's all.

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:24.210
But I'm asking why you lifted on two.

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:27.050
I'll do it myself.

00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:32.490
By the way, why are your ears so red?

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:34.120
Do you have a fever?

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:35.320
Don't.

00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:38.430
What? I didn't do anything.

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:42.800
- I think you're making it worse. - Stop it.

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:45.070
Let me.

00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:46.400
Go take a break over there.

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.539
What a mess.

00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:51.740
Tell me about it.

00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:57.110
So, now,

00:47:57.950 --> 00:48:00.080
are we done pretending we're strangers?

00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:02.920
You're really something else.

00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:05.520
You just say whatever pops into your head.

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:07.660
So brutally honest.

00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:11.860
As I recall, you were the same way.

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:22.100
Oh, this is nice.

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:44.130
You know,

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:47.700
I just wanted to live a quiet, orderly life.

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:49.500
I did.

00:48:50.370 --> 00:48:51.370
Like that.

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:38.410
Enough with the chitchat.

00:49:39.350 --> 00:49:41.680
Let's finish cleaning.

00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:58.970
Oh, yes, Director.

00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:02.770
Yes, I'm on my way. Yes.

00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:07.280
I have to get back to the office now.

00:50:10.650 --> 00:50:11.710
Hold on.

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:17.150
Pick up when I call you, okay?

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:18.920
Bye.

00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:20.890
Right.

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:24.460
Just in case you try to back out,

00:50:25.290 --> 00:50:27.060
I brought a little bribe.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.330
Wear these so you don't get hurt.

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:34.240
Gosh.

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:36.470
These are the ugliest gloves I've ever seen.

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:40.740
It's the thought that counts.

00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:41.910
Just deal with it.

00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:42.980
I'm off.

00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:51.250
She left without even cleaning up.

00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:53.690
Here is the food.

00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:55.760
- Thank you. - Enjoy.

00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:02.160
Why are you so glued to your phone?

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:07.770
Social media? I thought Nu Ri handled that.

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:08.840
She does.

00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:11.309
I'm waiting for a call.

00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:12.809
I'll get chewed out if I miss it.

00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:15.110
They must have a nasty temper.

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:16.380
You could say that.

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:18.049
Well, you kind of ask for it.

00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:19.350
So just keep your phone on you.

00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:20.720
Okay.

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:23.990
Oh, I'm meeting one of Jin Mu Yeong's fans soon.

00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:25.650
I see... What?

00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:27.820
Don't I get a say in this?

00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:29.119
I'm your agent, remember?

00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:31.429
Don't worry. I'll be the one meeting her.

00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:33.299
Then why turn down all the paying gigs?

00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:34.860
Shush.

00:51:38.370 --> 00:51:39.900
I had a feeling you'd call.

00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:42.570
Let's meet at the cafe on Saturday at 2pm.

00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:44.310
I'll send you a map with the location.

00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:52.250
You're up?

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:54.220
Here, have some juice.

00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:58.519
Why are you working at home?

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:00.160
Are you obsessed with money?

00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:02.360
Hey, Nu Ri.

00:52:03.090 --> 00:52:05.030
Do people your age even read books?

00:52:05.090 --> 00:52:06.090
Books?

00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:08.059
Not really. Why?

00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:09.900
Apparently, I have a fan.

00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:11.830
And I think she's around your age.

00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:13.740
It's just surprising.

00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:16.340
I'd almost forgotten myself.

00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:18.610
Did I actually write a book?

00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:21.410
Didn't you write a novel for me when I was a kid?

00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:25.880
But wasn't the story a bit too hard for a preschooler?

00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:28.049
Well, it's better than just dumbing it down...

00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:30.149
and writing some childish story. That's way worse.

00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:32.520
If you wrote it for me, it should be at my level.

00:52:32.590 --> 00:52:35.360
Please. You fell asleep every time I read it.

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:36.760
Whatever, just forget it.

00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:41.030
What is it?

00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:44.569
They say if this breaks on its own, your wish is supposed to come true.

00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:46.669
What's the wish that hasn't come true?

00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:48.040
For you to do as I say.

00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:51.070
Then I guess this is never going to break.

00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:53.110
It won't. It's never breaking.

00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:55.940
Never ever.

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:01.650
Hey, go hang up that laundry.

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:03.490
Yes, Producer.

00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:07.159
Oh, yes, that's fine.

00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:08.320
Right. Okay.

00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:11.560
Yes, take your time. See you then.

00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:16.230
- Oh, you're here. - Yes.

00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:20.069
What's with the flower?

00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:22.270
Oh, for the fan?

00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:24.410
It's for you.

00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:26.740
You used to like this flower.

00:53:26.810 --> 00:53:27.810
I did?

00:53:32.110 --> 00:53:34.080
- Do you want to drink something? - Sure.

00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.749
Oh, our guests are running a little late.

00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:37.950
They're stuck in traffic.

00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:39.119
Guests? As in, plural?

00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:42.090
Yes, a variety show producer and his daughter are coming.

00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:45.789
It'll be a good connection for you to have.

00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:46.860
Actually,

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:49.500
it'll be a huge advantage for you in many ways.

00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:52.799
He's experienced,

00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:54.770
but as for you being Sunwoo Hae...

00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:57.670
I doubt he'll recognise you.

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:02.540
It's pretty.

00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:05.910
A fan who wants to meet me.

00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:08.520
I can't believe I fell for that.

00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:10.220
What?

00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:14.190
Hey.

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:16.990
Hey, where are you going?

00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:22.200
Hey.

00:54:23.570 --> 00:54:25.170
You can't just leave.

00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:29.139
If this is the subject, I see no reason to stay.

00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:32.310
Wait, are you thinking I made up the fan thing entirely?

00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:35.040
Your fan is a minor. She's in high school.

00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:36.679
Is it odd to bring her guardian?

00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:39.280
But to you, the key seems to be that her guardian is a producer.

00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:41.950
I won't deny that.

00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:48.420
That's what this was from the start.

00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:51.659
I wanted this to be personal, and this is the payback I get.

00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:54.800
Is anything ever purely personal between alumni who meet as adults?

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.129
It's a mix of both. What payback?

00:54:57.130 --> 00:54:59.100
After I objected to being used for someone's nostalgia,

00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:01.840
I tried to use you for my own.

00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:09.109
I made it perfectly clear I wanted you here as a writer.

00:55:09.110 --> 00:55:10.250
So what's the problem?

00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:11.350
The problem?

00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:15.780
You're right. What could be the problem?

00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:22.420
To you, am I...

00:55:23.530 --> 00:55:26.090
just another feather in your cap?

00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:30.900
What, were we supposed to have a happy reunion and catch up?

00:55:30.970 --> 00:55:33.029
It's not like we were ever so close, were we?

00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:34.100
In that case,

00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:36.870
do you even believe me?

00:55:43.110 --> 00:55:45.350
Well, if it isn't my junior.

00:55:45.610 --> 00:55:47.980
- Hello, Producer. - Welcome.

00:55:51.550 --> 00:55:52.720
It's an occupational habit.

00:55:52.790 --> 00:55:54.389
You weren't secretly pleased?

00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:55.390
You're here.

00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:57.390
Oh, no, what do I do?

00:55:57.990 --> 00:55:59.230
Which one of you is...

00:56:04.070 --> 00:56:05.929
Hello, I'm Jin Mu Yeong. It's a pleasure.

00:56:05.930 --> 00:56:07.399
Yes, I'm Yu Je Il.

00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:10.740
You look so distinguished. So that's why you've been hiding?

00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:15.780
I'm applying to the creative writing department.

00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:17.779
My teacher says I have a knack for it,

00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:20.010
and that I should really pursue it in college.

00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:22.850
Do you use a pen name?

00:56:23.650 --> 00:56:25.189
May I ask what your real name is?

00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:26.320
Dad!

00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:28.160
Stop being so nosy.

00:56:30.790 --> 00:56:32.759
If you have a chance,

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:34.529
would you mind looking at my writing?

00:56:34.530 --> 00:56:37.270
He's a busy man. Why are you bothering him with that?

00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:42.840
If you think my opinion would be helpful...

00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:44.869
I'm not sure how helpful I'll be, but...

00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:46.610
It already is helpful!

00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:49.039
Oh, my goodness.

00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:52.010
Oh, but how did you end up becoming a novelist?

00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:54.949
I was just trying to make money, you know.

00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:57.120
I think that's pretty much why I started.

00:56:57.620 --> 00:56:59.549
So it wasn't for some grand, noble reason.

00:56:59.550 --> 00:57:01.190
Gosh, Dad. Seriously.

00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:07.160
I think that's a really refreshing reason.

00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:09.060
I want to earn a living from my writing, too.

00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:10.400
I'll enter some contests.

00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:11.999
He was also...

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.599
famous for winning an award at every major contest he entered.

00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:18.470
Oh, right. You first published in high school.

00:57:19.070 --> 00:57:20.510
What was that like back then?

00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:23.140
Back then,

00:57:23.410 --> 00:57:25.680
he definitely had a certain aura.

00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:29.519
So everyone found her a little hard to approach.

00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:31.520
That's how it was, right?

00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:33.050
You...

00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:34.690
had no idea, did you?

00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:38.330
I had no idea.

00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:42.730
But doesn't he look just like the Sunwoo Hae from back then?

00:57:42.830 --> 00:57:44.270
You get that a lot, don't you?

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.400
To say he looks like him...

00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:50.770
He's lacking in the looks department, don't you think?

00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:55.680
Me?

00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:58.449
Who on earth is Sunwoo Hae?

00:57:58.450 --> 00:57:59.979
Stop showing your age.

00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:02.149
What's with you? Why are you so mad at me?

00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:04.220
Drop the act. What's wrong with you?

00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:06.350
I'm deeply in your debt today.

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:09.290
You handle Mo Tae Rin, right? Let's set up a meeting.

00:58:10.930 --> 00:58:11.930
Thank you.

00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:15.959
Thank you. Goodbye.

00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:17.400
It was nice seeing you.

00:58:19.230 --> 00:58:20.640
Take care.

00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:25.909
That producer asking for a meeting right to your face...

00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:28.080
and you taking him up on it. Unbelievable.

00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:30.750
What was I supposed to do, turn him down?

00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:33.480
If I get hung up on that, when will I get work done?

00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:35.280
Fine.

00:58:36.450 --> 00:58:39.450
It must've been tough, pretending you were happy to see me.

00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:41.220
That's a harsh way to put it.

00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:49.730
Because it seems you've never once been happy to run into me again.

00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:56.600
Let me ask you something.

00:58:58.770 --> 00:59:01.540
If that high schooler's guardian wasn't a producer,

00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:04.310
would you still have set us up because she's my fan?

00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:07.349
What's your point?

00:59:07.350 --> 00:59:08.650
I was just curious.

00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:11.120
About what you're like.

00:59:12.690 --> 00:59:13.760
It's just...

00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:16.990
For people who shine as brightly as you do,

00:59:17.090 --> 00:59:19.090
I was curious about the dreams you have.

00:59:25.770 --> 00:59:28.470
So, what kind of person did you expect me to be?

00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:34.310
Thanks for sticking around today.

00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:38.010
I don't know about you, but in any case, I owe you one.

00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:41.150
And I appreciate your time.

00:59:42.850 --> 00:59:44.050
I wish you all the best.

00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:47.190
Okay.

00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:50.460
You too.

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:17.020
Oh, right. She asked me to delete this.

01:00:17.650 --> 01:00:19.590
No wonder she wanted it deleted.

01:00:19.690 --> 01:00:21.490
This is the best shot you could get?

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:26.590
(Move to Trash)

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:30.060
Hey, can you run to the store and get some green onions?

01:00:30.730 --> 01:00:32.270
Get some fresh air while you're at it.

01:00:32.770 --> 01:00:34.270
Green onions? What for?

01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:37.010
It's just I can't stand seeing you moping around like this.

01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:39.670
We're not busy right now, so it's fine. Go on.

01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:40.839
Go on and get some air.

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:42.240
- Are we out? - Yes.

01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:54.420
So, what kind of person did you expect me to be?

01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:38.900
What?

01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:44.970
Seriously, what?

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.680
What are you doing here?

01:01:50.650 --> 01:01:51.980
Well...

01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:55.580
I feel like there was something...

01:01:55.650 --> 01:01:57.820
I didn't get to finish saying earlier.

01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:02.090
I mean, it's just that...

01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:05.490
That flower from earlier...

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:10.530
I cut the stems at an angle, so all you have to do is add water.

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:14.439
I figured if you don't have a vase, you'd have a plastic bottle.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.770
Then you can recycle it.

01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:19.210
And change the water once a day. Okay?

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.350
Is that what you came all this way to say?

01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:27.980
Yes.

01:02:29.050 --> 01:02:30.820
Well, that and other things.

01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:32.790
I mean...

01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:40.290
Sunwoo Hae?

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.570
You might as well hang a sign giving the wrong idea.

01:02:52.210 --> 01:02:53.370
Wrong idea about what?

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:57.210
Being seen with a guy is the perfect way to start rumours.

01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:59.250
Having my life exposed here is the last thing I...

01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:01.580
Hey.

01:03:02.550 --> 01:03:04.650
- What happened to your shirt? - What?

01:03:06.090 --> 01:03:07.760
You're incredibly strong.

01:03:08.890 --> 01:03:09.960
Well...

01:03:10.730 --> 01:03:13.060
I told you I was strong.

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:15.930
Why would you wear a shirt that's this flimsy?

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:18.199
Will it dissolve in the rain?

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:20.100
I've had this for ten years.

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:21.369
How frugal.

01:03:21.370 --> 01:03:23.200
I guess you could say that.

01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:26.570
How did you know where I work?

01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:30.950
Wasn't this an invitation for me to come find you?

01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:33.510
No, it wasn't.

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:35.020
I see.

01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:37.120
Why are you here?

01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:38.450
And in an apron, no less.

01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:42.260
I was in a rush.

01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:45.460
Is this look too scandalous for you?

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.730
I wouldn't go that far.

01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:52.530
So now...

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.940
if we feel like it,

01:03:59.210 --> 01:04:01.540
we can see each other whenever, right?

01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:12.350
Guess not.

01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:43.120
What was that about?

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:46.320
Just...

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:50.860
saying I was happy to see you.

01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:56.500
Bye.

01:05:03.970 --> 01:05:05.040
Hey!

01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:17.390
If you're that happy, at least buy me a meal.

01:05:18.490 --> 01:05:19.550
And drinks.

01:05:21.490 --> 01:05:23.520
It's not like we're 19 anymore.

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:22.020
(To Sung Je Yeon, Sunwoo Hae)

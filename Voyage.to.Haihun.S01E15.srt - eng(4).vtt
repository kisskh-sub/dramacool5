00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.880
Lord Wang.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.050
Lord Wang.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.600
Milord, Lord Huo wants to

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:41.640
see you now.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.460
Alright, let's go.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.840
(History records say,)

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.710
(his strides are all the same.)

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.920
(Is that true or not?)

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.150
One.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.050
Two.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.910
Three.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.880
One.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.890
Two.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.760
Three.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.040
One.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.030
Two.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.990
Three.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.120
(He even steps right into puddles.)

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.240
(He truly has OCD.)

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.470
Ninety-six.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.470
Ninety-seven.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.590
Ninety-eight.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.710
Ninety-nine.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:24.750
One hundred.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.030
Lord Wang, you've been waiting long.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.470
It's my duty.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.870
Morning, Lord Huo.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.360
From now on, every ten days,

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.990
you'll discuss state affairs
with the generals.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.870
Lord Wang, be sure to be there on time.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.710
Mm.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.010
We're to discuss the defense arrangements

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.530
for the entry
of the Duke of Changyi's into the city.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.460
I shall keep that in mind, milord.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.040
Come with me.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.620
Lord Huo, after you.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.010
One, two.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.600
Move.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.720
One, two, three.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.560
Good morning, milords.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.260
Good morning, Lord Huo.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.870
Come, come.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.390
Allow me to introduce everyone.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.800
This is Lord Wang Heng.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:17.910
And this is

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.040
General of the Chariots Zhang Anshi.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.560
(Zhang Anshi, General of the Chariots)

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.210
General of the Frontier Fan Mingyou.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.710
(Fan Mingyou, General of the Frontier)

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:26.910
Front General Han Zeng.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.940
(Han Zeng, Front General)

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.800
Rear General Zhao Chongguo.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.540
(Zhao Chongguo, Rear General)

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.520
I'm recently appointed.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.280
I ask for your guidance, Generals.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.590
Please bear with me.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.960
Generals, please be seated.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.910
Generals.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.000
The Late Emperor's funeral is imminent.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.960
The New Emperor will soon ascend the throne.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.900
We must tighten security around the Palace.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.840
The foremost agenda

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.990
of today's meeting

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.310
is the defense arrangements of the entry

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.240
of the Duke of Changyi into the city.

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.940
(Duke of Changyi's Mansion)

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.240
This mansion in Chang'an...

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.680
I never came here as a child.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:25.720
It's quite grand.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.540
Qingge, where are you going?

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.920
Slow down.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.390
(Strange and peculiar,)

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.720
(and even ignoring me.)

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.950
Duke, you've had a long journey.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.600
You should rest early.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:42.830
Where are you going?

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.240
I've settled things with Huo Guang.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.540
He gave me an honorary title.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:46.680
Wait for my word.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.050
Wang just arrived and already got a post.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.070
Could he be one of Huo Guang's men?

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.130
That's impossible.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.040
I believe in Heng.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.560
He's highly capable,

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:04.570
so it's natural.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.600
He must have his reasons for doing this.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:09.720
We just need to trust him.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.750
What worries me most right now

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:18.680
is not Wang Heng.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:21.800
Then who?

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.440
You.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.400
Me?

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.060
I am Imperial Censor Yan Yannian.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.510
(Yan Yannian)
Greetings, Duke.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.530
It's quite late for a visit to me.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.000
What brings you here?

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.270
A family matter.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.390
Please, Duke of Changyi, step aside.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.700
I'm here to discipline my daughter.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.150
Your daughter?

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.060
You just said your surname is Yan.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.120
But her surname is Xu.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.320
Her given name is Yan Luozhu.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:22.590
Father.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.400
Say no more.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.000
Qingge.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.560
I'll be right back.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:55.870
What's happened?

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:57.550
I've been away for many years

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.800
and haven't seen my father for long.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.600
I'll return home first.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.360
I'll come back in a few days.

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:06.250
Alright.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.380
Let me walk you out.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.880
- Mm.
- Let's go.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.310
So your name is Yan Luozhu.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.040
After all this time, I just found out.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.160
My given name is Yan Luozhu.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.510
My father sent me away when I was young.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.630
So you feel sadder
the closer we get to Chang'an.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.410
It's because of that.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.220
Mm.

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.660
(Duke of Changyi's Mansion)

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.550
Duke, you just arrived in Chang'an.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.070
Be careful with your words and actions.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.270
As an Imperial Censor,

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:41.700
it is my duty

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.070
to watch over your every word and deed.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:48.460
Father.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.000
Could you please say less?

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.430
I'll go back with you now.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.660
Have a proper talk with Lord Yan.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:55.720
I'll come find you later.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.390
Just stay in the mansion, okay?

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:58.230
Giddy-up!

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:01.470
Lord Yan.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:03.270
So you've met

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.360
Wang Heng before?

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.080
I have not.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.090
My lord, Lady Luofu's belongings are ready.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:24.480
Bring Yanfu out.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.530
- Yes, my lord.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.430
Why are you sending her away?

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.770
We're caught in the chaos of Chang'an.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.390
Crown Prince has plotted rebellion.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.660
But we haven't been involved.

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:33.500
The realm is in chaos

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.920
and there's the witchcraft affair.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.820
Sending her away is the only way
to keep her safe.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.440
I don't want to leave Chang'an.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.910
Why must you send me away?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:42.840
My lady.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:43.750
Get her in.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:44.960
I don't want to go.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.080
I don't want to go.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:51.880
I don't want to leave Chang'an.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.830
I'm not leaving.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.510
What are you staring at?

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.080
Get inside already.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.130
Has anything changed at home?

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.090
Nothing much since Mother passed away.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:26.360
But all the servants are replaced.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.320
All men are born with eyes and ears.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.320
Eyes and ears breed secrets.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:38.000
Where there are secrets,
there is a hidden world.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:39.320
This world is vast.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.030
Isn't that normal?

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.760
But the one I'm talking about is different.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.480
This is the Imperial Court.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.890
The tides of officialdom

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.500
rise and fall with the court.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:49.750
Born into this vast world,

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.550
one ought to see the world.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.960
If one's life is spent as a caged bird,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.240
how pitiful that'd be?

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:01.240
How long do you plan to keep messing around?

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.220
The Duke will ascend the throne soon.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:08.990
I trust you have records of the matters

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:10.920
of misconduct among the officials.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.320
What has that to do with you or me?

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:15.380
Father.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.220
You have always been upright,

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.660
serving the realm, so why would you…

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.030
Chang'an has never truly known peace.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:22.460
The court is no place

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:23.310
for games.

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.320
No matter the wealth or glory one holds,

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:27.540
one careless move,

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.860
and the whole game is lost.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.920
In an instant, it all turns to the past.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:33.080
Everything is ruined.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.050
Such glory and wealth
are meant for the officials.

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.590
It has nothing to do with the commoners.

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:38.620
Yet some officials insist

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:39.620
on claiming everything,

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:40.840
getting caught in it deeper.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.120
Once you're forced out,
the price is heavy.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.730
If you lack the resolve
to fight til the end,

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.890
then don't step into this mire.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:50.880
Do not interfere with me.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.000
I have my own plan.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:57.230
Father.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:01.130
Is there someone
you'd risk your life to protect?

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.000
I don't care about others.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.670
But I have one.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.600
Is it truly worth it?

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:11.920
It is worth it.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.280
Father.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.120
I beg you.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:25.910
Just this once.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.200
But

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.150
you must promise me one thing.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:34.060
(Duke of Changyi's Mansion)

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:34.920
Qingge.

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:36.290
Come here.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:38.920
Take a look.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:48.470
What is this?

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:53.170
I asked my father
for the records of officials.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.520
To secure your throne,

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.360
you'll need them.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.260
Thank you so much.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.360
Mm.

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:07.080
Also, Duke,

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.000
after you ascend the throne,

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.340
you must rein in your willfulness.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.360
Chang'an is nothing like Changyi.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.550
So many eyes are on you.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.080
Do not misuse your status
to act recklessly.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:18.770
Be open to all counsel.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.720
Do not insist on your willful ways.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.520
In all matters, think ahead

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.080
and plan carefully.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:24.920
And also,

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.000
steer clear of

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:27.570
excessive drinking and indulgence.

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.560
They'd cloud your judgment.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:30.970
Mind your rest and meals,

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:32.020
so your health stays sound.

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:32.860
Ah,

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.790
why are you reminding me like this,

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.390
as if saying farewell?

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.360
I am but a common folk.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.510
When you ascend the imperial throne,

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.320
the difference between us would be vast.

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:44.800
By then,

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:45.960
you might not heed my words,

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:48.260
nor could I always remain by your side.

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.350
That's simple.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.270
Once I ascend the throne,

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:53.600
I'll grant you a post.

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:54.770
You choose.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.670
A woman like me could not

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.200
serve as an official.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:02.720
Why not?

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:07.270
You care so much about my daily life.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:09.790
Why not

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:11.320
make you the Empress?

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.480
Then you can watch over me every day

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.320
and take care of me.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:16.940
Truly?

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.870
Truly.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.600
You've been my dearest buddy
since childhood.

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:23.960
We share blessings together,

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.120
so why not?

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:26.960
Buddy?

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.150
Heng says the closest friends

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.330
should be called "buddy".

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.240
My lady, it's getting late.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:40.230
Oh...

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.040
Are you headed out?

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:43.790
Will you be back?

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.860
I haven't been back long.
My father plans to

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.120
take me to visit some relatives.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:50.920
I'll take my leave now.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:52.350
Mm.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:02.390
Duke.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.630
Mind your meals and rest.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.120
Stay in good health.

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:07.390
And also...

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:09.550
Oh, you already said that just now.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.850
I've remembered everything.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.790
Go on now, come back early.

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:28.000
I'll be waiting for you.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:46.770
My lady.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:48.440
A carriage is waiting outside the city.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.580
It's getting late.

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:50.550
We should set off now.

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:51.390
Let's go.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:10.590
And also...

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.480
Duke, don't forget me.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.320
Steamed bun for sale.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.550
Meat-filled steamed bun.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.790
Fresh meat-filled steamed bun.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.750
Sir, care to try one?

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:36.870
Sir, take a look over here.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:38.180
Fresh from the steamer.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.470
I don't want to leave Father and Mother.

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:42.340
Have they decided to abandon me?

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:44.320
I can be good and obedient.

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.360
As long as they can stay by my side.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.440
They don't want me anymore.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.560
That's not true, my lady.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.360
We will return again.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.510
- Be good.
- I don't want...

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:54.670
I don't want to.

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:55.560
Be good, my lady.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.940
We will return again.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.320
Wait a moment, my lady.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.320
It's an inspection.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:11.840
Next.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.020
The Imperial Palace has its own rules.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:19.010
Once you're in it, better follow them.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:19.860
It's done, my lady.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:21.360
We can leave now.

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:22.510
My lady.

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:25.270
My lady? She's run off.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.600
She's gone. Quickly, find her.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.440
My lady.

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:32.980
Hey, where are you going?

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:35.980
We're setting off already.

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:37.510
- Where are you going?
- I...

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:38.350
Get in the carriage.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.710
Don't cause me trouble.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.740
Hurry and get on.

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:44.310
Alright, everyone inside.

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:50.840
Come on, move quickly.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:51.850
Keep up at the back.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.280
Hurry, hurry.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.400
All lined up.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.270
Listen carefully, everyone.

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.830
When you meet Empress Dowager, be smart.

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:21.810
If you provoke her displeasure,

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.150
you might just lose your head.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.400

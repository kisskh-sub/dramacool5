00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I have uncovered the truth
in Lord Wang's case.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.920
It was all a trap set by this man.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.690
The evidence is irrefutable.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.680
Duke, you're wise indeed.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.710
This man dared to frame an official.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.250
By law, he should be executed.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.260
Why not let the court convict him?

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.920
He is a man from Changyi.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.590
I failed to discipline him.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.760
I am the Duke of Changyi.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.960
Leave him

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.000
to me.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.550
This...

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.190
Very well.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.350
Then I'll report the truth to the court.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:01.630
In that case,

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.590
can Wang Heng be released now?

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.090
Of course.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.120
Release him at once.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.310
Guards! Release him!

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.240
I'm free now?

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.450
Is everything clear?

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.310
Lord Wang, you have suffered.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.530
It's him.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.030
Should I call you Bushi now

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.310
or Shan?

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.680
My name is

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.310
Chen

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.590
Shan.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.970
Why did you frame Heng?

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.440
I was jealous.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.310
Wang Heng.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.280
Why does everyone hold you
in such high regard?

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.190
I've served

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.150
by the Duke's side for years,

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.000
yet the Duke values you more.

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.190
In the court of Chang'an,

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.750
I've worked with all my heart and soul,

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.360
but no one ever noticed me.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.080
Then you showed up,

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.490
and suddenly everyone favored you.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.240
Why is that?

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.080
Is it just because you bear
the destiny of the Qilin?

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.680
So, out of jealousy,

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.420
you tried to kill

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.670
the woman we saved?

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:19.930
I didn't kill anyone.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.470
Then why did you walk
into her room with a dagger?

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.630
I was desperate and reckless.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.040
In the end, I wasn't able
to harm her before I was caught.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.940
But one woman did lose her life.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.430
It wasn't me who killed her.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.430
I have no idea

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.270
how she died.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.480
Who's the one behind you?

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.600
Who exactly is backing you?

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.570
You shadowy scoundrel.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.720
Speak!

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.290
Knowing it won't do you any good.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.760
Duke.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.830
I've shown you enough mercy.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.720
Hyah!

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:12.500
Hyah!

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.310
Hyah!

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.750
I just remembered something.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.950
What is it?

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.390
The first time I met him,

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.040
it was just like now.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:30.660
That day,

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.390
I slipped out of the city,

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.360
and Lord Gong dragged me back again.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.000
I got on the carriage,

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.620
and that brat was sitting right there.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:41.570
Guess what he was doing.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.100
- What?
- Reading.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.110
Reading?

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.160
From that day on,

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.190
Lord Gong had him follow
your lord everywhere

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.630
to keep an eye on me while I read.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.650
Oh, well.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.610
I was furious, really.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.640
"Your lord"?

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:57.610
It means me.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.520
Out, brat.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.590
And then?

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.210
Later on,

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.340
he escaped the city with me.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.430
He's not like other study companions.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.970
He didn't care for being confined
to the academy.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.450
Much like me.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.600
In fact,

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.160
my impression of Chang'an
also came from him.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.800
Once,

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.390
he came back from Chang'an

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.480
and told me
about its bustling streets and sights.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.610
From the moment I stepped into Changyi,

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.550
my mission to keep watch had begun.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.250
No,

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:39.480
to me,

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.690
it was the start of our friendship.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.560
I've imagined this very scene

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.030
before me countless times.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:02.830
You standing before me,

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:05.360
demanding answers,

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.680
and asking why I spied on you

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:09.510
and why

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.140
I betrayed you.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.270
Now, that day has finally come.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.070
To my surprise,

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.780
I feel strangely calm and at ease.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.370
Hyah!

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:33.650
Hyah!

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.080
Shan is gone.

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:18.510
Our brotherhood has come to an end.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:21.240
Go now.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:23.590
Hide your name and your past.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.240
The farther you go, the better.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.020
I've made arrangements
for the young lady.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.140
Someone will protect her

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:52.290
until she's fully recovered.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.610
I'll wait for you at the gate.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:54.450
Sure.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.870
I understand how you feel.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.730
Fate can be cruel.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.380
But as long as Shan still lives,

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.100
the Mandate of Heaven
has already shifted.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:05.980
From this moment on,

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.520
our destiny is ours to command.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.490
Let us hope so.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:17.500
Duke.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:19.360
All is prepared.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.230
We can set out now.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.440
Lord Gong.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.720
I have a favor to ask.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.440
Please speak, Lord Wang.

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:29.260
If Lady De Jiu hadn't risked her life,

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.910
I wouldn't have survived,

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.420
and the Duke's reputation would suffer.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.830
Lord Gong,

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.220
please let her stay.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.550
My senior is skilled in martial arts.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:39.970
If she stays, she can protect me.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.610
I understand.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.790
With Lady De Jiu here,

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.390
she will surely safeguard

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.270
Lord Wang's safety.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:50.510
Thanks, Lord Gong.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.840
Let's go.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:38.840
Who's there?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.900
Chen.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.060
We used to be brothers.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.010
I should see you off.

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:59.510
Who told you to act on your own?

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.150
The court only ordered you
to investigate,

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.970
not to frame others.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:10.230
You...

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.200
Zhang Sheng.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:23.630
Those who act on their own

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.840
always end up like this.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.160
Lord Zhang, you are decisive.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.600
He failed two tasks

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.060
at hand

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.360
and nearly exposed me.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.320
Milord,

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.030
how do we report this to our superiors?

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.540
When passing through Hongnong,

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.390
the Duke of Changyi ordered Shan
to drive the ladies.

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:49.750
Once this was discovered,

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:50.960
the Duke of Changyi denied it,

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.430
had Shan arrested,

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.800
and handed him to the Chief Guard
for execution.

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:58.440
(When passing through Hongnong,)

00:11:58.510 --> 00:11:59.390
You're truly wise.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.520
(... ordered Shan to drive the ladies.)

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:02.790
(At Hu,)

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.010
(the envoy reproached An Le.)

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.010
(An Le reported to Gong Sui.)

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:08.360
(Gong Sui questioned the Duke.)

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.530
(The Duke)

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:10.530
(denied it.)

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:11.710
(Gong Sui said,)

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:12.670
("If not,")

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.270
("why favor Shan so
as to ruin justice and honor?")

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.810
("Please arrest him")

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:18.630
("to clear your name.")

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.750
(Thus, Shan was seized and executed.)

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.220
(From Volume XVI, Annals of Han,
Zizhi Tongjian.)

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.520
We'll be in Chang'an soon.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.840
Why did Bushi suddenly return
to Changyi?

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.360
Duke, what secret mission
did you give him?

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:40.600
Since it's a secret mission,

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.310
how could I tell you?

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:43.870
You have a mission, too.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.870
What mission?

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.440
To safeguard our realm

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:48.960
and the Liu's reign.

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:50.870
It's our duty.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.550
Lord Wang, you don't look well.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.080
Is your health troubling you?

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:58.290
It's nothing.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.390
We're getting close to Chang'an.

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:03.020
I just feel a little uneasy.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.390
How can you say so?

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:06.990
At such a crucial moment,

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:09.030
your health is of the utmost importance.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.960
We must be careful.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.200
Lord Gong.

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:14.840
He's about to delay the journey.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.620
Shouldn't that call
for a word of caution?

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.750
The Duke's kindness toward officials

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:20.240
is a blessing.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.040
Lord Wang.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.290
You must rest well.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.320
Once in Chang'an,
we'll be relying on you a great deal.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.580
(Hongnong Lodge)

(Wucheng Village, Hu County)

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.140
Let me help you.

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:59.140
(Wucheng Village)

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:01.510
Wucheng Village.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.510
Let's go.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.110
Everyone,

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.210
we are passing through here

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:17.060
and need a short rest.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.480
- Don't worry.
- We won't intrude.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.320
It's all right.

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.270
(Ren Xuan, Village Chief)
I am Ren Xuan, the Village Chief.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.200
Everyone,

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.670
though gold is cheesy,

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:29.800
we do have to trouble you.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:30.810
This is a small token.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.870
Please accept it.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.120
No need; make yourself at home.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.940
I'll arrange a few empty houses for you.

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.080
I hope you won't mind.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.300
- Please.
- How impressive.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.300
Everyone, you may leave.

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:43.110
- Alright.
- Let's go.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.040
Please.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:07.750
What are you doing?

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:09.110
Heng.

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.080
Come.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:13.920
Sit here.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:17.710
What are you doing?

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:19.910
Come on, put your legs up.

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:21.750
Get some proper rest.

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:23.350
Take a short nap.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:25.320
Here, lie down.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.960
How can I sleep
when it's still bright outside?

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.430
Close your eyes,

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:32.320
and then it'll be dark.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.910
Come on, close your eyes.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.850
Sleep is about to overtake you.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.390
I can't sleep at all.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:40.950
Who naps here in broad daylight?

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.810
I spent a hefty sum

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.040
to buy you some peaceful rest.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.200
Did he take your money?

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.090
He refused; what's it to me?

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.270
Come on, do me a favor.

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:51.120
Yes, lie down.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.090
Please, just this once.

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:54.460
Good.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.060
What are you doing here?

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:12.100
Why are you still here?

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.480
Attentive in every way.

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:14.550
Always ready to help.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:16.710
Go, go, go.

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:18.340
With you here, I get the chills.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:20.910
Alright, alright.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.430
Sorry about that.

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.370
Got it.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.520
Senior, where are you going?

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:53.110
Qingge.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:55.960
Qingge.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.060
What happened?

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:00.150
How's Wang?

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.570
He's doing fine.

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:04.640
Why do I feel

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:06.640
something's off with you?

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.000
It's nothing.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.920
I just want to rest
after the long journey.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.300
Hey, let's chat for a bit.

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:19.290
Where is everyone?

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.560
Where have they gone?

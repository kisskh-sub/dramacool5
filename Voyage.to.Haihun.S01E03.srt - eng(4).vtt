00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.680
Soon, the Duke will be able to go

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.840
to Chang'an with full honor.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:28.720
Why is that?

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.370
(Because I know the history, you fool.)

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.830
This is the Mandate of Heaven.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.520
I can only tell the Duke.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.090
Just handle the equine administration

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.820
and lift the Duke's confinement.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.090
What else is there to fear?

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.990
But

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.790
if you fail to do so,

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.650
we'll all lose our heads.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.500
(Trying to scare me?)

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.490
(Huh.)

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.350
Alright.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.070
I have one condition.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.910
Speak.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.120
Once it is settled,

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.500
I must see the Duke immediately.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.150
Deal.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.430
(So gullible.)

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.600
After you.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.600
(Unfamiliar face.)

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.680
(Easily swayed.)

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.640
(Not bad at all.)

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.790
(A fine stand-in.)

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:03.920
(I'll leave the city)

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.150
(very soon.)

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.120
That's it?

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.300
Ow! Be gentle.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.630
Does that hurt?

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.590
Ouch.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.190
Hey, go easy.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.430
That hurts, too?

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.740
Physician Li is great.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.020
He's also Li Qi's father.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.200
You should trust him.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.150
Thanks.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.400
Is Wang Heng badly hurt?

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.620
(Li Zhong)
He landed hard on his rear

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.440
and bumped his eye.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.410
No injury to the bones.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.920
Nothing serious.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.500
Then I'll leave him in your hands.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.060
Alright, I'll take my leave.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:46.990
(I must have the Immortal)

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
(learn to ride,)

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.980
(or my whole plan falls apart.)

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.470
Let me be straight with you.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.280
Once the horse affairs are settled,

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.200
Lord Gong will have the Duke
race with the people.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.780
As the event host, I'll arrange
for you to join the match.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.640
Then you'll get to compete with him.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.560
Really?

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.460
Of course, I'll take care of it.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.470
But you must also give it your all.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.150
At least, you need to know
how to ride a horse.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.680
(To meet Liu He,)

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.310
(just tolerate this fool for now.)

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.430
Step aside.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.800
I'll practice.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.990
(Done.)

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.280
(Next, I must persuade Lord Gong)

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.280
(to agree to the horse race
outside the city.)

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.380
(Let me try the method
the Immortal taught me.)

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.520
(Watch me.)

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.800
Lord Gong, Chancellor.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.070
Duke.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.030
Duke.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.580
I've invited both the Chancellor
and the Governor here.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.030
Do we need manpower or money?

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.850
Let's hear it.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.870
(Chancellor of Changyi, An Le)
What's your plan?

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.050
A horse race outside the city.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.400
Horse racing.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.670
To seek amusement?

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.770
That is not so.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.760
If I delight in music here,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.680
the people will hear my bells and drums

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.140
and the sound of flutes and pipes.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.840
They'll beam with joy
and tell each other

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.640
that I must be free from illness;

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.160
otherwise, I couldn't have made music.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.340
When I go on a hunt,
the people will hear my chariots

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.240
and see my banners.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.930
They'll beam with joy
and tell each other

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.390
that I must be free from illness.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.510
The reason is simple.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.120
It's to share my joy with the people.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.480
If I rejoice with the people,

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.660
that is what makes me a true duke.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.160
I believe

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.270
the equine administration

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.120
should be more than just raising
and trading horses.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.520
The equine administration

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.200
should also win the hearts
of the people.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.240
Rejoice with the people.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.040
It's to make them feel happy

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.240
and passionate about the administration.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.750
Wouldn't that be a fine thing?

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.120
Once people have passion,

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.670
the equine administration
will surely work.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.050
For this horse racing event,

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.320
we must rally all of Changyi

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.360
from the officials to the people

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.080
and also

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.710
count on the Chancellor's support.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:03.590
Very well.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.050
If the equine administration prospers,

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.760
it'll surely be a grand event
for Changyi.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.310
I've brought the official seal.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.160
If you want to issue a decree,

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:12.480
just go ahead and do it.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.610
What do you think, Lord Gong?

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.270
I have one condition.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.890
You must set the equine administration
in order within the city.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.600
As for the horse racing outside,

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.190
I will make sure everything is arranged.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.810
- (Half done.)
- Good plan.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.590
(Regardless
of the equine administration,)

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.950
(this stand-in)

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.700
(must first learn how to ride a horse.)

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:30.650
Left.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.400
Right.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.940
You should've pulled.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.040
Put some feelings into it.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.880
Yes, feelings.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:37.820
Good.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.120
Be good.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.970
Mm, good.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:40.870
That's right.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.400
See? There are feelings.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.720
Get up.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.600
If you can't overcome
even this small hurdle,

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.800
how will you face the Duke?

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.890
Another ten laps.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.700
(Qingge Tavern)
I've pondered.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.800
To make it work,

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.340
we have to earn through horse breeding.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.340
But these days,
few in Changyi keep horses.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.750
How can we revive
the horse-rearing custom?

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.560
Our land just isn't fit for it.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.760
Exactly.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.760
Don't any of you have a good idea?

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.340
I do.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.200
Say it.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.100
Since ancient times,

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.950
it's always been breeding many
from a few.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.270
Yes, that makes sense.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.560
Why not borrow all the city's horses
from the people?

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.680
We can gather them together
in one place,

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.270
keep the stallions and mares together,

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.740
and let them breed foals.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.360
When the foals grow up,

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.270
they'll be worth a fortune.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.040
Naturally, people will want
to raise them.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.040
That's a fine plan.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.190
I have another idea.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:40.390
Go on.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.080
We could open a few horse meat diners.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:43.330
With so many coming to eat,

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.950
people would surely raise more horses.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.880
Mm.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.870
Where would the horses

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.100
for the diner come from?

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.210
Naturally,

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.780
from Bushi's horse ranch.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.360
Everything

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:56.720
links together.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.310
A truly brilliant plan.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.560
Well, I have one, too.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.400
Shut up.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:01.950
Ha ha ha.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:04.030
Well, in just a short while,

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.310
you've come up with so many good ideas.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.600
Here in Changyi,

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:09.870
we truly have no shortage of talent.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:10.800
Our equine future

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.830
is right within reach.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.160
It's all thanks to your fine teaching.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:16.880
Hold on.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.840
It seems you've long been ready
for horse affairs.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:24.310
But I only know

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.230
how to toil in the horse ranch.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:28.960
So, gentlemen,

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.170
would you answer a few questions?

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.580
Heng, ask away.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.560
- Bushi.
- Mm.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.760
How long does it take
for a foal to grow up?

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.560
One year of feeding.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:42.640
- One year to mature.
- Two years.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:44.480
Can the Duke wait?

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.500
What if the foal dies?

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.920
All these horses are borrowed
from the people.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.120
If the people have no horses

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:51.830
to use,

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:52.970
what are they supposed to do?

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.150
Zhang Sheng.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:58.760
His horses can't be relied upon.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.600
What will happen to your diner?

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.600
You can't do this.

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.910
Then...

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.750
What about buying from another county?

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:08.510
Horses are so costly.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.000
- Who'll cover
- Quiet.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.530
the cost every year, you or the people?

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.990
You didn't consider the cost,

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.070
the time needed,

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:15.160
or the risks.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:17.170
You're quite something.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.320
Alas.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:23.880
Lady Qingge.

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:25.360
You said in your land,

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.190
everyone knows how to ride?

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.190
Yes, in our land,

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.680
riding is a skill everyone must have.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:32.470
(Got it.)

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.810
Heng, do you have a clever plan?

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.360
It's time

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.090
to show you, people of the Han,

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.000
a taste of true economics.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:47.620
(Changyi)

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.150
Come and see!

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.000
Changyi Riders Racing with the Wind.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:53.960
Make way, make way!

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:55.720
The Grand Horse Race

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.790
is coming!

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:57.720
The Grand Horse Race

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.720
is coming!

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.240
Do we need such a grand scene?

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:01.030
Of course.

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:03.160
The aim of the administration
is to make a profit.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.130
It doesn't necessarily mean
raising horses.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.460
It could be an event instead.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:09.270
For any event, early publicity is vital.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:11.540
Publicity brings topics.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.520
Topics spark conversation.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:14.970
(Grand Horse Race)
Conversation

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:16.210
leads to trending searches.

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:16.950
Trending searches?

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.720
(Changyi Li)
It means money on the way.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:21.510
Right now,

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.690
the win or loss in racing speed
doesn't matter.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.260
People serve the horses.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.040
The rider is what truly matters.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.900
Voting decides
whether a rider can compete.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:31.750
(No.1 Horse, Odds)

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.540
A competitor's fate lies

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.060
(No.1 Horse, Odds)
in patrons' hands.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.640
(Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding)
Fate is precious.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:37.710
Come on.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:40.390
Get ready for tonight's carnival.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:41.510
Dear villagers,

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:42.630
gather around!

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.320
I have an announcement to make.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.630
The Changyi Equestrian Festival

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.200
will officially

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:48.670
open its grand curtain

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.000
at sunset

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.020
on Water Street of the Western Market.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:53.750
Great.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.020
Good.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:57.510
I understand now.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.440
Fate

00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.670
is money.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.600
No.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.840
Fate

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.160
is a sense

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.360
of control.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.030
Do you really think

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:08.840
this will work?

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.910
You'll know

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.080
the answer tonight.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.030
Was that performance exciting?

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.890
Yeah.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:18.870
Good, good.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:21.830
Let's welcome our next group.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.670
Alright.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.670
Alright, first,

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.080
please introduce yourselves.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.030
A warm welcome!

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.270
Alright.

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:32.930
I am Xu Pingjun, the Geng contestant.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.240
(Chou, Geng)
I'm from Changyi.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.120
Alright.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.910
I am Du Ruofeng, the Chou contestant.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.270
I come from Huling.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.510
Great.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.080
Now, please present

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.480
your talent performance for us.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.240
Great.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.000
Let me break the wood

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:48.240
with my iron palm.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.950
Great.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:50.790
Come on.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.240
Bravo, bravo!

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:04.630
That was incredible.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.870
Alright, come on.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:08.120
Let's welcome our next contestant.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.270
Alright.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.080
For everyone here,

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.120
I'll perform a piece

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:15.440
of Western Regions dance.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.510
Alright.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.600
Du Ruofeng, we'll go wild with you!

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.360
Changyi even has such a man?

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.510
Ruofeng.

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:22.750
I'm cheering for you!

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:25.320
Great!

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.190
I know your kindness

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.150
is truly hard to refuse today.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.550
But I ask everyone here

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.410
to calm your restless hearts

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.080
and steady your trembling hands,

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:34.550
and let us together look forward

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:35.910
to the contestants'

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.970
wonderful performances.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:39.840
Great.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:42.750
(Qingge Tavern)
Once everyone likes horses,

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:45.240
the price of horses will naturally rise.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:47.110
By then,

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.750
everyone will cherish horses

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:50.120
and raise horses.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.960
If we make a profit,

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:54.790
we can even bring top-quality stallions

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:56.200
from the Western Regions

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.240
to improve our local breed.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.440
Mm.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.000
Heng makes good sense.

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.620
Only the wealthy and noble come here.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:08.760
You only earn

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:10.390
from the wealthy

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:11.930
and not from the people, huh?

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:13.470
Brilliant.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.670
We'll see if it's brilliant later.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.030
Right now, I just want

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.270
to free the Duke.

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:23.360
Now, let's welcome Lady Qingge
to perform for us.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.480
Great.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:35.870
Alas.

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:38.320
It makes me want to give the girls
two Carnival Gifts.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:39.510
Just two?

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:41.630
I'd say at least ten.

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.150
That'd better suit your noble status.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.170
Hey.

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:48.880
You're actually going for it?

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:51.130
Then make it at least 20.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.560
Great, great.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.320
Please give me your support.

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:00.390
Sure, sure.

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:01.270
Alright, everyone.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.200
Both ladies have finished
their performances.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.360
I think

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:06.790
it's time for everyone

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.080
to cast their votes.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:09.750
Yes, cast our votes!

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:14.280
Cast our votes!

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.480
Top Patron,

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.480
where are the ten Carnival Gifts
you promised?

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.550
No rush.

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:20.270
I'll send Lady Miaomiao
three Triple Sixes.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.360
(Triple Sixes)
Thanks for the three Triple Sixes.

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:26.550
Good for Mr. Liu.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.270
Lady Qingge

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:30.670
seems to be falling far behind.

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:32.550
I believe right now,

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:36.790
Lady Qingge should also have
her Top Patron.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.080
Don't you all agree?

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:39.150
Yes!

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.350
That's right!

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:45.910
Defend the championship!

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:48.360
If you haven't voted for Miaomiao,
come on now.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.750
20 Carnival Gifts for Qingge.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.380
20 Carnival Gifts.

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:53.440
Great, great.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.120
20 Carnival Gifts.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.420
(Carnival Gift)
Great, great.

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:01.320
It's for Lady Qingge,
the Chen contestant.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.320
Everyone,

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:04.840
I declare:

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.870
Lady Qingge

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.120
has claimed the top spot.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.720
She earns a place
in the preliminary horse race.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:17.020
Good.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.380
Good.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:21.760
- 15.
- No.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.000
15.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:23.840
Here, drink.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:25.840
Drink.

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:27.150
You lost.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.800
This 15-20 game was your idea.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:31.940
Besides,

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.520
aren't you an Immortal?

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:35.080
How could you not foresee this?

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.790
I'm just indulging you out of joy.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.160
Here, take it.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:47.710
Oh.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.720
If the equine administration does well,

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.620
there will be rich rewards.

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:56.110
You're starting to sound like the Duke.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:00.770
Careful, or I'll report you.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:02.890
Go on, keep playing.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:03.970
No, I'm done.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:04.920
I'm done drinking, too.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.030
Just let me

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.520
rest in this scent of copper coins

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:14.470
and drift peacefully to sleep.

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:17.600
Such small ambitions.

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.180
Never seen money before, have you?

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:20.060
That's right.

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:22.590
I'm no royalty or nobility

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.570
who grew up in comfort and luxury.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:30.260
Commoners like us

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:34.140
take life's beatings day after day.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.280
It's all the same.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.180
Duke.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.510
Slow down; don't trip.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.080
I command you to play with me.

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:09.390
Humph.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:24.920
Who are you?

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:26.710
My mother delivers vegetables here.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:27.920
She brought me in.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.220
- You like it?
- Mm.

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:35.710
Then it's yours.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.230
Thank you.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.720
That makes us good friends now.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.870
Next time you're at South Market Street,

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.710
just say you're looking for Zhao Wu.

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:45.630
We'll play again.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:46.840
Deal.

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.030
- I'll bring more toys.
- Okay.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:50.180
Why are you playing here?

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:51.230
Come with me.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.320
Don't forget.

00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:15.720
Have you seen Zhao Wu?

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.440
Zhao Wu's whole family
was slain by Liu He.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:19.960
Liu He is truly vicious.

00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:20.950
Parentless

00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:21.910
and ill-bred!

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:23.790
A snot-nosed duke!

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:24.630
Right.

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:27.080
Parentless and ill-bred!

00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:28.480
- Not true.
- A snot-nosed duke!

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.000
That's not true.

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:30.780
Parentless!

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:31.830
He's not that kind of man.

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.240
- And ill-bred!
- That's not true.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.610
A snot-nosed duke!

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:36.240
How can you defend Liu He?

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.380
The Duke is over there.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.280
Let me go.

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.310
Disrespecting the Duke.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:43.260
- Punish them.
- Don't.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.590
- Take them away.
- Let me go!

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:45.800
Don't take them.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.480
- Don't take them!
- Let go of me.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.400
Please forgive us for being late.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.690
Zhao Wu's break-in broke the rules.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.890
Those wild children insulted you.

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:02.240
That's even worse.

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:03.480
They can't be forgiven.

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:05.700
Duke, do not grieve.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.070
The rules you speak of

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:10.680
are the very ones
that get people killed.

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:13.800
Why should I follow them?

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.310
(Over a decade has passed.)

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:22.500
(Yet I still can't leave Changyi.)

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:26.340
(Even if I left the fief,)

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.370
(I'd be sentenced
to a grave punishment.)

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.180
(Time to take a gamble.)

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:31.720
(If the Qilin can grant wishes,)

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.110
(I just wish everyone could forget me)

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.000
(or go somewhere no one knows me.)

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:38.490
(That would be enough.)

=Voyage to Haihun, Season 1=

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.260
=Episode 18=

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.310
Much obliged, Your Majesty.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.280
In private, just call me sister.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.230
Grandfather insists my uncle,
Huo Yu, follow along.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.150
I need to think of a plan.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.680
Have you made up your mind on this?

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.710
Lord Huo is your grandfather

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.510
and also your only family.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.470
But he wiped out the Shangguan Clan.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.310
If Uncle doesn't go with me,

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.680
Grandfather will grow suspicious.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:51.790
Do not worry, sister.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.200
I know how to handle this.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.430
Thank...

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.840
Thank you, sister.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.920
Your Majesty,

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.150
you plan to leave the Palace today.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.960
This matter is of great importance.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.560
It's best to have Huo Yu go with you.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.630
Only then can I be at ease.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.240
He is tied up with duties.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.590
I have my guards to protect me.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.470
Great General, you need not worry.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.120
Then…

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.160
Please take care, Your Majesty.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.800
Thanks for seeing me off, Great General.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.870
Let's depart.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.750
(Wucheng Village)
Everyone,

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.780
line up and stay safe.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.640
Take good care

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.840
of yourself too.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.710
Mm.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:11.550
Let's move out.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.590
Uncle.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:15.780
I'll go with you.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.260
No need to risk yourself.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.340
Uncle, I...

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.300
Just tell Liu He

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.200
to honor the promise.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.670
Kang Ning, I entrust the village to you.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:26.920
Take good care of them.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.110
One day, lead them to a life of peace.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.500
Uncle Ren, how noble.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.500
I'll remember this

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.550
and take it to heart.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.010
A lifetime of toil

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.060
through life and death.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.350
If we succeed this time,

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.670
we'll have no regrets even in death.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.930
Uncle, take care.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.340
(Huo Mansion)

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.260
Lord Huo.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.120
If there's nothing else for me,

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.100
I shall take my leave.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.140
Hey.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.460
No need to rush.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.810
You rarely come by.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.620
Stay and chat with me a while.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.700
Enjoy some flowers.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.660
Alright.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.660
Look at these blooms.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.590
They were brought from Changyi last year.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.540
How do they look?

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.900
Umm..

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:20.740
They're lovely.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.500
Their beauty stands out
among all flowers,

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.540
because they follow the rule
of the seasons,

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.020
drawing in nourishment constantly

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.220
and striving to grow.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.390
So they can take root here in Chang'an.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.430
Thank you for your teaching, Great General.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.520
But even the finest flower

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.860
will wither one day.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.740
A pity, really.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.060
Ah, indeed.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.060
You serve as an official here in Chang'an.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.540
Has the work been going smoothly?

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.400
I am but slow-witted,

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.360
yet diligence can make up for it.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.480
I recall the first time we met,

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.150
you left quite an impression on me.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.800
I thought you were a young man of ideals,

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.660
destined to achieve great things here.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.740
At least, that's how I saw you before.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.500
And now…

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.020
What about now?

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.140
Now…

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.380
to speak plainly,

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.200
you have greatly disappointed me.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.540
I am but slow-witted,

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.540
and have made many faults in office.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.500
Milord, I beg your forgiveness.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.540
You know that's not what I meant.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:51.940
Time's almost up.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.340
Let's go.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:20.860
What is the meaning of this?

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.740
Your subject, Fan Mingyou,
greets Your Majesty.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.500
Please return to the palace.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.260
Seize them.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.860
How could you show such disrespect?

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.060
This is the order of the Great General.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.800
What are you doing?

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.140
- Let go!
- Drop your weapons.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.480
You traitors of Changyi!

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:46.380
Wang Heng.

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.870
I had hoped to guide you well.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.920
But you chose to act recklessly

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.520
and brought about this disaster.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.470
These lives were lost because of you.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.940
Guards,

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:04.900
take him down.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.460
I know there's no escaping fate.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.700
But there's one thing I want to know.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.180
If I know it,

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:18.700
I can go in peace.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.940
If I don't,

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.860
then let's perish together, milord.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.220
Go on.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.060
How exactly did you

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.500
see through my plan?

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:29.150
I...

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.460
You truly underestimated me.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.450
(Guess I lost this round.)

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:38.100
(Time to start over.)

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:40.980
Heng!

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.950
This time...

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:51.980
finally, no local food.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:00.260
Lord Huo.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.500
General Huo Yu is swamped

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.620
with duties.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.540
For the journey of the Empress Dowager,

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.500
may I be the one

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.220
to go in place of General Huo Yu.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.520
I've learned a lot from the generals.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:15.990
Milord, would you grant me this chance?

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.380
I swear to guard Her Majesty with my life.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:22.060
Granted.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.180
My thanks, milord.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.390
Thanks, Great General, for seeing me off.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.340
Lord Wang.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.740
This journey of the Empress Dowager,

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:39.300
I'd trouble you to see to it.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.820
Milord, this is but my duty.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:43.360
Rest assured.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:51.700
Set out.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.160
Xiao'an had a cake in her mouth

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.780
and burrowed straight into the plant pot.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.730
The scene should've been painted.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:10.940
Sister, she made much mischief yesterday.

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.930
She pulled out several tassel threads

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.290
from my newly cut brocade quilt.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:15.890
- Heng.
- The craftsmen were scared

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.990
- into kneeling all day.
- Were they really here

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.440
- to accompany?
- Also, she

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.410
left plum-blossom prints

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.230
all over the freshly dyed indigo cloth.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:23.370
A scout came to report.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.000
Huo Guang had set an ambush.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.600
Are they here to wipe us out completely?

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:30.820
Wang Heng isn't trustworthy.

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:31.970
From now on,

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.500
cut ties with them.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.900
There must be some misunderstanding.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.300
- They won't...
- Misunderstanding?

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.730
They set the ambush long ago.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.100
Isn't that obvious?

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.500
Whose carriage is that?

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.190
Not from the Imperial Palace.

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:00.430
Grandfather.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:08.600
Your Majesty.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.760
Grandfather, what brings you here?

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.820
The scenery here is truly beautiful.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.250
This is a perfect place to clear my mind.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.260
Lord Wang, anything unusual along the way?

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:25.520
Great General,

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:26.910
the road was peaceful,

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:28.260
nothing out of place.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.150
Lord Wang, you oversee the guards.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.490
Do you feel this is petty work
unworthy of you,

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.940
and that it diminishes your ambitions?

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.100
Not at all.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.200
I have been learning from you, milord.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.320
You often accompanied Emperor Wu before,

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.300
starting from the smallest of duties

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.960
before reaching the heights you have today.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:46.900
Good.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.940
I'm glad to hear you think this way.

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:52.220
After the funeral of the Late Emperor,

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.810
I plan to take you with me

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.140
to the South and North Armies' military camp

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.230
to witness the might

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.020
and to discuss matters of state.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:10:59.860
How is it?

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:01.740
Thank you, Lord Huo.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:02.580
Mm.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:17.270
Someone must have leaked the news.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:19.550
Too many loose tongues around.

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:20.940
The replacement plan

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.180
may not work anymore.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.370
My martial uncle acted with care.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:25.990
Or we'd have been exposed.

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:30.260
Sorry, Qingge,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.260
you worked in vain.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:32.860
I'm fine, really.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.830
What matters now is a new plan.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.670
Are there people loyal
to the Crown Prince among them?

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:41.700
Yes.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.050
To protect the Crown Prince's descendants.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:46.460
The Crown Prince's descendants.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.570
The descendants...

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.020
Liu Bingyi, great-grandson of Emperor Wu.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.340
The Inner Court.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.340
Greetings, milord.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.500
And you are...?

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.620
I am Xu Guanghan.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:59.500
Once a loyal servant of Changyi.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.760
- Where are you posted now?
- The Inner Court.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.460
I've met the Duke when he was young.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:04.310
Duke.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.060
Was there an official in Changyi
named Xu Guanghan?

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.680
Yes, there was.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:10.780
But I have little memory of him.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:12.720
He served under my father.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.460
Your father truly left you a fine connection.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.140
Lord Wang.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.240
Please.

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:30.260
Please.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:34.620
It is late in the night.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.980
For you to come in person to me,

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.130
is there some urgent matter?

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.420
Milord, is the Imperial Great-Grandson here?

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.900
(Supervisor of the Dyeing Workshop,
Xu Guanghan)

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:45.820
You may all leave now.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.060
He has gone traveling.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:57.940
He's been away for a while.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.060
There are guards of Crown Prince Wei
in Wucheng Village,

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.140
still protecting his orphaned son.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.140
They obey only his son.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:07.300
Is this true?

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:10.070
I have never heard of such a thing.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:11.580
Lord Xu,

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.220
I'll be frank.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.770
The Duke of Changyi wants to tell you,

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.860
he wishes to join hands
with Crown Prince Wei's son.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.160
What does he mean by this?

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.150
I'm not quite sure.

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:24.690
Of course you know, Lord Xu.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:27.470
It's common knowledge

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.720
you're the trusted aide of the Great General

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.630
and will be a close minister to His Majesty.

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:35.000
Naturally,

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.540
they are to team up.

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:39.700
It has nothing to do with the Inner Court.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.290
The Great General
doesn't bear the Liu surname.

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:43.920
Once Prince Wei's son returns,

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.480
please pass along my words.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.070
I, Wang Heng,

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.810
will draw up a thorough plan.

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:50.340
The guards of Wucheng Village

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.460
are to be swapped
with my men in the Palace.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:53.680
When the time comes,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:54.900
we'll unseat Huo Guang.

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.380
Lord Huo is no ordinary man.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.340
You don't just dismiss him at will.

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:04.850
You served Changyi
and are the father-in-law

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.660
of Prince Wei's son.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:08.300
If this comes to pass,

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:09.660
for you, milord,

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:10.940
there will be

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:11.960
countless gains.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.740
Lord Wang, you're bold indeed.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.220
Such words are enough

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.610
to condemn you to death.

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.440
I wagered that you wouldn't expose me,

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.700
so I laid out the entire plan.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.860
Please take your leave.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:38.900
Let's just say that

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.280
we didn't meet today.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:41.980
In the Zhenghe Year 2,

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.580
Crown Prince Wei, Liu Ju, was framed

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:45.770
and forced into rebellion.

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:46.900
The attempt ended in failure.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.920
During the witchcraft incident,

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.830
his infant grandson miraculously survived.

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.460
The child was imprisoned,

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.210
secretly raised by Court Warden Bing Ji,

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:57.780
with the help of two female prisoners,

00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:58.980
who became his wet nurses.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.100
One was named Guo Zhengqing,

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:02.340
the other Hu Zu.

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:04.300
Life in prison was harsh

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.310
and the child suffered
several serious illnesses.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:08.590
At last, he survived.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.840
Thus, he was given the name,

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:10.900
Bingyi.
[*Bingyi: Cured]

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.260
In the Houyuan Year 2,

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.140
Emperor Wu passed away.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.350
On his deathbed, he issued a decree

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:19.740
to have Liu Bingyi

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.100
raised in the Inner Court.

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:22.300
In the Shiyuan Year 2,

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.690
Bingyi formally moved into here
from the house

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.220
of his grandmother, Consort Shi.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:28.780
There, he met the person

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.100
he'd be most grateful to,

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.720
Zhang He, Prefect of the Inner Court,

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.740
who was close to the Crown Prince

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.990
and implicated in the witchcraft incident.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:37.690
He suffered castration,

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.500
yet he treated Liu Bingyi as his own son,

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:41.740
teaching him knowledge

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:42.740
and the virtues.

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:43.980
He lived only to

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.860
ensure the Crown Prince's lineage endured.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.060
Once, you asked Bingyi,

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.920
what he wished for most in this life.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:54.170
Bingyi replied that he longed

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.250
to serve as an official.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.420
He wandered since childhood,

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:00.600
seeing the warmth and cold of the world.

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:04.010
He knows good and corrupt officials
stand worlds apart.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.920
A greedy one, for selfish gain,

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:07.460
can ruin countless lives.

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.300
A good one, by fair rule,
can bless the land.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:11.800
Faced with corruption,

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.340
he sometimes yearns to kill.

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:14.560
Yet he knows the true path:

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.300
to be a good official,

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:17.940
to choose the worthy, make laws,

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:19.580
and bring peace to the people.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:21.500
Thus,

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.330
you named him "Ci Qing",

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:25.250
hoping one day he'd serve as an official.

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:27.850
Even with the lowest rank,

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:29.460
to serve the people

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:30.860
always comes first.

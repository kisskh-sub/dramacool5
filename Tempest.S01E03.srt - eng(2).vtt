TEMPEST

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:33.283
Mr. Im.

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:37.454
You're here.

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:10.862
UNITED MOTHERLAND

00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:20.998
- You published a new book?
- I did.

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:24.126
Although I didn't really wanna have
anything printed. Those poor trees.

00:01:25.294 --> 00:01:26.753
THE FATE OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:31.049
BY IM DUJIN

00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:40.851
Why didn't you visit me sooner?

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:44.604
I thought if I did,
I'd cry the second I saw you.

00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:47.607
So what if you did?
Your husband had just died.

00:01:49.026 --> 00:01:50.944
I still have so much to do.

00:01:51.028 --> 00:01:52.654
Oh, really? Like what?

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.659
I never did anything
for him when we were married.

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:02.748
So the least I can do is find out
why he was murdered.

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:08.295
If he risked his life for something,
I wanna finish it for him.

00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:12.215
I guess you feel like
you didn't show Junik

00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:15.385
enough affection when he was alive.

00:02:19.306 --> 00:02:21.558
I thought eventually
I could open up to him.

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:24.853
He was always such a warm and sweet man.

00:02:27.022 --> 00:02:30.359
All I had to do was just sit next to him.

00:02:30.442 --> 00:02:32.486
Peace and unity are hard to achieve.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.614
Even in the case of husband and wife.

00:02:38.617 --> 00:02:41.745
I saw your number
in Junik's call history pretty recently.

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:43.288
Were you two seeing each other?

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:46.625
Yeah. Over a month ago.

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:50.712
He showed me the letter he received
from his friend, the one in America.

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:54.675
I thought reunification

00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:57.344
was just an option
that was available to us.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.264
But I realize now we're sitting on
a time bomb that is war.

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:03.850
Like death, reunification is inevitable.

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:05.977
No matter how we try to avoid it.

00:03:06.645 --> 00:03:08.980
It's something that we have to face.

00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:11.775
I still have so much to learn, sir.

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:13.735
Teach me, please.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.614
After that,
he asked me to join his campaign

00:03:17.698 --> 00:03:19.700
to oversee the reunification initiative.

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:21.326
Did you accept?

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:27.791
The New Republican Party,
I just couldn't imagine joining them.

00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:32.170
By the way, are you moving soon?

00:03:32.254 --> 00:03:33.713
It looks like you're packing.

00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:34.965
Yeah.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.136
Over to Argentina.
I have relatives with a ranch.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.512
Argentina?

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.937
You know that I introduced Junik
and Father Yang.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.607
Just because they spoke out
about peace and reunification,

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:54.901
they were both killed horribly.

00:03:54.985 --> 00:03:58.572
People in this country love hate
more than peace.

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:00.740
They're obsessed
with faction and division,

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:04.453
and I just don't…
I don't want to live here anymore. So…

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:07.330
Sir.

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:09.833
I'm planning to run for president.

00:04:11.168 --> 00:04:13.462
You're the one
who taught me about the North

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:16.715
when I first returned to Korea to work
at the ministry of foreign affairs.

00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:19.843
Even though I did all my studying
in the US,

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:21.887
you were the person
I actually learned from.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.055
Your predictions about North Korea,

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.058
their actions and motives,
have always been accurate.

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:29.227
I need your help, Mr. Im.

00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:35.066
Munju.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.278
North Korea is helpless
and they're collapsing.

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:41.907
The US has to intervene.
The North has nuclear weapons.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.159
It's inevitable that war is near.

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:45.827
Those with compassion

00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:49.790
will be crushed
under the wheels of history.

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:51.833
I'm fine with getting crushed,

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:54.795
and so was Junik, and so was Father Yang.

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:00.884
But if you're willing to help me,

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:01.968
MUNJU CAMPAIGN OPERATION PLAN

00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:03.637
I'll do my best

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.680
to change the course of those wheels.

00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:10.101
{\an8}How were you able to capture that photo?

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:12.938
{\an8}As soon as I heard the gunshot,
I just kept pressing the shutter.

00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:15.816
{\an8}I was stunned to see a woman
suddenly enter the frame.

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:18.193
My God, who is that woman?

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:21.238
How could she stand at gunpoint
staring him down?

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.198
I think that that's the question
on everyone's mind.

00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:28.161
It is evident that Ambassador Seo
just exhibited extraordinary bravery

00:05:28.245 --> 00:05:32.290
{\an8}as she stood unarmed and faced the man
who had just shot and killed her husband.

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:35.252
{\an8}The newsmaker
of the week is Seo Munju.

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:38.421
{\an8}Former UN Ambassador and the widow
of the late assemblyman Jang.

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.048
Look at Ambassador Seo's eyes.

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:41.424
The courage and anger.

00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:44.261
Even in an extreme situation,
she remains completely composed.

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:45.637
People are now saying

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.347
she should've been the one
running for president

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.641
and that they'd vote for her
without giving it a second thought.

00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:51.518
{\an8}If Seo does decide
to run for president,

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:53.478
{\an8}which party do you think she'll join?

00:05:53.562 --> 00:05:55.897
I strongly think she should join
the New Republican Party

00:05:55.981 --> 00:05:59.401
and carry out her husband's
political legacy for him.

00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:02.195
Her candidacy will only have meaning
if she does.

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:04.114
However, Seo Munju has been

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.533
a symbolic figure in the administration
of Chae Kyungsin,

00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:09.202
the very face of our government, in fact.

00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:10.537
I know

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:13.081
that you went out of your way

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:15.959
to make sure Junik lost the primary.

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:20.380
Assemblyman Jang truly was
a-a valuable asset to our party.

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:24.134
Thanks to him, we gained a strong base
of young supporters,

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:26.344
but that was really it.

00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:29.472
There are principles that define
who we are as a party,

00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:33.351
and a key value is anti-communism.

00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:37.647
Our party was built on the blood spilled
across the 38th parallel.

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:40.025
And well, someone
who doesn't understand that…

00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:42.736
He couldn't be our candidate.

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:48.617
So then,

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.536
you were glad the day Junik died?

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:56.583
Why would you say that, ma'am?

00:06:57.208 --> 00:07:01.254
In September, 2015, in Santa Barbara,
California…

00:07:01.338 --> 00:07:04.424
…a drunk driver crashed her car
into a bar.

00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:08.053
Two were killed
and three seriously injured.

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:11.389
Two Koreans were arrested at the scene.

00:07:11.473 --> 00:07:13.558
A local masseuse and a prosecutor

00:07:14.893 --> 00:07:17.520
who was supposedly there
for overseas training.

00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:20.732
Prosecutor Jang Junsang.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.777
She was just someone I met that night.

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:27.405
I saw her being sexually harassed
and tried to help.

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:30.408
But she panicked and then ran to her car.

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:33.787
There wasn't enough evidence to charge me.

00:07:37.082 --> 00:07:38.833
There wasn't enough then.

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:40.919
What if there is now?

00:07:49.094 --> 00:07:51.096
You know, when my husband died, he, um…

00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:55.016
he left me this huge file cabinet
with drawers.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.142
Kind of funny, right?

00:07:57.018 --> 00:07:58.520
After all those years in politics,

00:07:58.603 --> 00:08:00.855
the only thing he left behind
was one file cabinet.

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:02.232
The thing is,

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:04.693
one of those drawers had your name on it.

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:06.319
HWANG MANGI

00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:09.614
And when I opened it,
I found some very interesting things.

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:13.785
So today…

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:16.913
I thought I'd share this.

00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:24.963
Look at that face,
like father, like daughter.

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:27.507
I mean, it'd be embarrassing to deny it.

00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:30.593
That was over 20 years ago!

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:34.139
Everyone in politics had
illegitimate kids then!

00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:36.850
The woman told the police
that she was the driver, okay?

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:38.017
I don't remember anything!

00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:43.231
Come here, get over here!

00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:44.482
Shut up! You better not say a word…

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:46.651
I spoke to your wife
for the first time in a long time.

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:48.778
- You hear me?
- She's willing to testify against you.

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:51.406
She was gonna stay silent for her kids.

00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:54.325
But she couldn't bear the thought
of her abusive husband

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:55.618
running for president.

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:57.996
Mom did this?

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:04.586
You got my own mother to help you.

00:09:06.337 --> 00:09:09.049
Seo Munju had
an excellent global reputation

00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:11.092
as a UN ambassador.

00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:16.097
Plus, she's a woman, and female leadership
is the dominant trend worldwide right now.

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:18.516
Leave.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.188
Just say you're going to Germany to see
your kids while they study abroad.

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:32.655
This is what she always does.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.116
She does, she…

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.827
She always makes me feel like trash.

00:09:39.037 --> 00:09:40.455
Well, you can tell her

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:44.000
that since this is where she's
taking things, I'll see you all in hell.

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:46.419
And you should also remember

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:48.922
that when I leave the country,

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.383
I won't be empty-handed when I return.

00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:01.309
After this,

00:10:02.685 --> 00:10:04.938
your political career will be finished
for good.

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:09.109
I gotta say,

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:11.861
I've always wondered…

00:10:12.821 --> 00:10:17.200
What gave you the audacity to plot
with all of those people against Junik?

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:22.038
You remember, showing up
at our house for the New Year

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:24.082
knowing that you didn't belong there?

00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:41.683
Okay, so what is it that you want from me?

00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:50.483
Junsang leaves for Germany tonight.

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:54.404
And Munju runs for president this year.

00:10:57.574 --> 00:11:00.952
And I want you to stay out of her way.

00:11:01.035 --> 00:11:02.954
Considering her background with the UN,

00:11:03.037 --> 00:11:06.666
some folks are skeptical about her skill
set in managing the government, right?

00:11:06.749 --> 00:11:10.211
Well, regarding past presidents who were
diplomats, we've had Choi Gyuha.

00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:13.756
South Korea is among
the ranks of the world powers,

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.925
which makes diplomacy
a matter of survival.

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:17.010
That's right.

00:11:17.093 --> 00:11:20.680
First of all, I'm going
to turn her into a spectacle.

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:26.477
Then, the spectacle will grow
into a phenomenon.

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:29.981
And eventually…

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:33.484
she'll become a legend.

00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:36.279
Representative Hwang, hello!

00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:39.199
Is it true Seo Munju will
run in the presidential primary

00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:40.325
for the New Republican Party?

00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:42.160
As far as I am concerned,

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:46.331
Ambassador Seo Munju is entirely focused
on determining the ideal way

00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:48.666
to share the vision of
the late Assemblyman Jang with the world.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:52.045
You know, truthfully, the biggest
criticism I've faced from my party lately

00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:54.923
is that I didn't bring on
Ambassador Seo any sooner!

00:11:55.006 --> 00:11:56.966
- Excuse me.
- When will the primary…

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.427
What was it that made
the Ambassador decide to run?

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.804
{\an8}Report any issues from the advance
team's inspection,

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:04.432
{\an8}double-check the contact network
of the local authorities.

00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:05.850
Oh, yes, hold on, please.

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:07.518
Uh-huh. Let me know
if anyone gives you a problem.

00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:09.229
And which hospital did you speak to?

00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:12.690
Hi, Miji Yeo, campaign manager. Yes?
Yeah. Uh, three people?

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:14.609
Ms. Seo.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.904
Six different organizations
did a flash poll

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:20.531
on the New Republican Party's
presidential candidate yesterday,

00:12:20.615 --> 00:12:24.244
and you've suddenly jumped to first
or second rank in all categories.

00:12:24.327 --> 00:12:25.995
PRIMARY CANDIDACY
ANNOUNCEMENT D-6

00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:30.708
Wow, do you… Do you have any clue
how nuts it is outside?

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:32.085
I don't know how they got our number.

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:35.088
The phone's ringing constantly,
people want to volunteer for the campaign!

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:38.716
Man, this is so one of those times where
you say, "You're slaying it, baby girl!"

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.051
Did you say, "slaying it?"

00:12:40.134 --> 00:12:41.928
So fire, girl! You're totally lit!

00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:44.889
Wait, fire? Why are you…

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:47.642
Anderson, did you get ahold of him?

00:12:47.725 --> 00:12:50.520
Uh, I've been trying using
various channels,

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:52.063
I still haven't reached him though.

00:12:52.146 --> 00:12:53.982
I got his sister's contact
number yesterday.

00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:55.900
The minute after I've heard back,
I'll reach out.

00:12:57.235 --> 00:12:58.945
Uh, no, I'll try it myself.

00:12:59.028 --> 00:13:02.031
Also, Miji, I keep getting these emails
from someone.

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:03.741
Can you do me a favor
and see what it's about?

00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:05.201
JOSE KIM
SHIV HOLDINGS INHERITANCE INQUIRY

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:07.036
- I'll forward you everything.
- Yep, got it.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.831
I unlocked Assemblyman Jang's computer,
and his cell phone,

00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:11.499
and restored all deleted logs.

00:13:11.582 --> 00:13:14.168
Multiple records exist of him
accessing a secure email site.

00:13:14.252 --> 00:13:16.004
It's hosted on an encrypted server.

00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:19.465
It's known for airtight security,
that even the FBI can't crack.

00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:23.052
Each user is given a fifteen-character
encryption key to use.

00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:26.848
You think you could crack the code?

00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:29.892
These SincereMail emails aren't easy
to decrypt.

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:32.854
I can give it a try, but I can't
promise you that it'll work.

00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:37.942
Are you in a meeting?
I couldn't get you on the phone.

00:13:38.901 --> 00:13:41.696
It's been ringing constantly,
so I put it away.

00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:45.783
Get another phone under your aide's name.
It's what everyone does.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:50.371
This is going well for us.

00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:54.292
The first ones to sniff out a rising
politician are the ones with money,

00:13:54.375 --> 00:13:57.503
and a lot of those folks are dying
to sponsor you as the candidate.

00:13:58.296 --> 00:13:59.964
I mean, I haven't done anything.

00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:03.968
We've set the stage for you.
Put the lights on. Music's cued up.

00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:07.680
And now it's your turn to show up
and perform for the crowd.

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:10.183
Your debut must dazzle them.

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:13.895
So, let's… let's kick it off
with a triple axel.

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:17.857
Wait, a triple axel? How?

00:14:19.108 --> 00:14:20.568
This coming Sunday,

00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:23.154
your campaign announcement is
at Gwanghwamun Square.

00:14:23.237 --> 00:14:26.115
We'll pull in a huge crowd
without using any agencies.

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:30.078
The public sees you as Joan of Arc.

00:14:31.162 --> 00:14:35.041
The woman who stood unarmed in front
of her husband to protect him from a gun.

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:41.005
And we need to keep them seeing you
that way and make them shed tears for you.

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:45.384
The easiest thing would be for you

00:14:45.468 --> 00:14:48.513
to shed some tears of your own
when the time is right.

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:54.185
I don't think that I can.

00:14:56.979 --> 00:14:58.606
Do you really want to be the president?

00:14:58.689 --> 00:15:01.651
No one's ever become president
without shedding tears in public.

00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:06.656
Crying shows all of them what you value
the most, it's your vulnerability.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:10.201
And as far as how convincing
everything looks,

00:15:10.284 --> 00:15:13.037
well, that's entirely up to you now,
isn't it?

00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:16.124
You nail it and that's your triple axel.

00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:23.214
I've had an experienced writer draft
your speech for you.

00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:26.717
Also, the cue is marked
where you should start crying,

00:15:26.801 --> 00:15:28.553
so get that down before Sunday.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:37.728

TO ANNOUNCE CAMPAIGN ON THE 19TH

00:15:49.073 --> 00:15:50.908
7 P.M. IN GWANGHWAMUN SQUARE

00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:05.381
Mr. Hwang?

00:16:05.464 --> 00:16:07.592
The director of the NIS called me.

00:16:07.675 --> 00:16:08.676
Why?

00:16:08.759 --> 00:16:11.637
Well, he said there's been suspicious
action from the US.

00:16:11.721 --> 00:16:14.098
Several Americans flew in
ahead of her announcement.

00:16:14.682 --> 00:16:15.683
Who is it?

00:16:16.392 --> 00:16:17.393
The CIA?

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:19.937
They weren't the only ones.

00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:22.648
Seo could be in a lot of danger.

00:16:45.796 --> 00:16:46.797
Cheers.

00:16:47.381 --> 00:16:48.841
Come on in, guys.

00:16:57.225 --> 00:17:01.771
We received intel that "Red Feather"
Billy Gray arrived in Seoul yesterday.

00:17:03.397 --> 00:17:05.858
He's putting on quite the show
for the cameras.

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:19.830
To us, they're still
our brothers and sisters.

00:17:19.914 --> 00:17:24.252
The recent Human Rights Commission report
on North Korea was heartbreaking.

00:17:24.335 --> 00:17:30.049
Far into the future, when we look back,
and think about what we have done,

00:17:30.132 --> 00:17:35.263
I sincerely hope that we will be able
to say that we did the right thing

00:17:35.346 --> 00:17:37.098
for the people in North Korea,

00:17:38.182 --> 00:17:43.187
who deserve to live
a decent life just like us.

00:17:44.021 --> 00:17:45.481
MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS

00:18:07.837 --> 00:18:08.838
Hello?

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:10.047
Did I wake you?

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:11.549
Why are you calling?

00:18:11.632 --> 00:18:13.593
You're about to be
a presidential candidate.

00:18:13.676 --> 00:18:14.802
You should be awake already.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.763
If you have something to say, say it.

00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:19.932
If your goal was
to surprise me, you nailed it.

00:18:20.016 --> 00:18:23.728
Honestly, it was like I was slapped
in the face. Which is new.

00:18:23.811 --> 00:18:26.897
I never thought that you would stand up
to me like this.

00:18:27.398 --> 00:18:28.691
You know,

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.902
I don't care if you do become president.

00:18:32.486 --> 00:18:34.989
But this is still my term
and I have my own plans.

00:18:35.072 --> 00:18:36.324
I told you…

00:18:36.407 --> 00:18:39.160
…I'll do whatever I have to,
to stop this war.

00:18:39.243 --> 00:18:41.537
If you get in my way,
I will come after you.

00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:43.789
Just thought I'd give you a heads-up.

00:18:44.373 --> 00:18:45.791
I was always fond of you.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.712
I wasn't trying to surprise you.
And it wasn't to stand up to you.

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:53.716
But still, I highly doubt
you'll be able to do this.

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:57.428
You don't think I can manage
to stop the war,

00:18:58.429 --> 00:19:00.264
but somehow you could do it?

00:19:00.348 --> 00:19:03.934
You said, Junik's death was our chance
to work with the US,

00:19:04.018 --> 00:19:05.603
to handle it diplomatically.

00:19:07.188 --> 00:19:08.189
I disagree.

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:10.983
It's our chance to learn
what really happened.

00:19:11.525 --> 00:19:14.904
A diplomatic attempt will fail
if it's rooted in lies.

00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:16.781
Hmm, by the way,

00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:19.158
I hope you realize…

00:19:20.368 --> 00:19:23.329
a candidate without approval
from the US could never get elected

00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:24.914
as the president of South Korea,

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:26.874
and they don't want you
leading this country.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:31.212
So watch your back.
I say that with genuine concern.

The journey you make
from Gwangju to Seoul…

00:20:44.493 --> 00:20:46.871
should serve as a campaign announcement.

Hey, you know, I've honestly

You finally making your debut in politics.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:30.200
I have to say, I think this is possibly
the best day of my life.

00:23:35.706 --> 00:23:39.668
I took this time to embrace
the stories of those who built Korea

00:23:39.752 --> 00:23:43.422
into what it is today,
and their grief, which still lingers.

00:23:51.347 --> 00:23:53.849
Hi everyone!

00:23:53.933 --> 00:23:57.144
{\an8}You must've been waiting a while.
I hope you're not completely exhausted.

00:23:57.227 --> 00:23:59.271
No!

00:24:00.564 --> 00:24:01.941
Thank you.

00:24:04.985 --> 00:24:06.737
Seo Munju, I need to see her.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.072
Who are you?

00:24:08.155 --> 00:24:11.492
I have to speak to her now.
It's an emergency.

00:24:12.785 --> 00:24:14.119
You were at the church, weren't you?

00:24:14.203 --> 00:24:17.831
Listen to me.
Seo Munju can't get on that train.

00:24:18.916 --> 00:24:22.294
Okay. Uh, Ms. Seo,
it's Changhee on the phone.

00:24:23.462 --> 00:24:26.215
- Hi, Changhee.
- Get off that train now, Ms. Seo.

00:24:27.841 --> 00:24:28.842
What?

00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:33.514
Don't sit down, do you hear me?
Don't sit down!

00:24:40.354 --> 00:24:41.605
Ms. Seo.

00:24:42.189 --> 00:24:43.565
Paik Sanho, is that you?

00:24:44.775 --> 00:24:47.027
You need to stay in that seat now,
don't get up.

00:24:47.778 --> 00:24:48.779
Is that clear?

00:24:50.197 --> 00:24:51.198
What are you saying?

00:24:51.281 --> 00:24:55.661
Stay in your seat, and make sure
you do not get up for any reason.

00:25:00.749 --> 00:25:03.085
Are you seeing this?
We should stop broadcasting for a minute.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:07.464
What should I do?

00:25:07.548 --> 00:25:10.009
I want you to try to find the man
that fixed your seat.

00:25:13.345 --> 00:25:14.346
Miji.

00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:20.060
LIVE BROADCAST WILL RESUME ONCE
THE TRAIN ARRIVES IN 40 MINUTES!

00:25:25.774 --> 00:25:27.568
So, I guess he wasn't even an employee.

00:25:27.651 --> 00:25:29.153
Apparently, they only fix things like that

00:25:29.236 --> 00:25:30.988
after the trains are shut down
for the day.

00:25:31.071 --> 00:25:32.656
My name is Paik Sanho.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:36.410
I was special forces in Iraq
running security since 2007.

00:25:36.493 --> 00:25:38.996
Terrorists often plant
explosives under seats.

00:25:40.414 --> 00:25:42.458
And if I get up again, it'll detonate?

00:25:42.958 --> 00:25:45.127
It will if it has a pressure
release switch.

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:48.130
But if it's a time bomb
it'll detonate at a set time.

00:25:52.468 --> 00:25:53.677
First, call the police.

00:25:53.761 --> 00:25:54.762
I-I'll call now.

00:25:55.345 --> 00:25:57.264
- Which stop is next?
- Asan Station.

00:25:57.347 --> 00:25:59.141
- And after that one?
- Gwangmyeong.

00:25:59.224 --> 00:26:01.351
See you in Gwangmyeong.

00:26:04.354 --> 00:26:05.564
I need to step away.

00:26:06.148 --> 00:26:07.232
I'll come right back.

00:26:16.283 --> 00:26:18.035
Some guy came and fixed the seat,

00:26:18.118 --> 00:26:20.913
but the railway confirmed
he wasn't one of their workers.

00:26:20.996 --> 00:26:25.292
In Iraq, that would likely mean
they planted explosives under the seat.

00:26:25.375 --> 00:26:28.295
Ma'am,
you're not in Iraq. You're in Korea.

00:26:33.008 --> 00:26:34.885
The police are gonna meet us
at Gwangmyeong Station.

00:26:34.968 --> 00:26:36.512
Okay, I'm on the way there.

00:26:37.471 --> 00:26:39.389
I'll arrive in 15 minutes at the station.

00:26:39.473 --> 00:26:40.849
We're in first class, car three.

00:26:41.809 --> 00:26:45.896
Miji, go talk to everyone else who's here
and get them to another car.

00:26:47.314 --> 00:26:48.482
Yeah, I'll make it happen.

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:52.444
What's going on?

00:26:53.779 --> 00:26:55.155
We start in an hour.

00:26:55.823 --> 00:26:57.282
Just get her here now.

00:26:57.366 --> 00:26:59.451
Okay, I'll reach out
when everything's done.

00:27:24.017 --> 00:27:25.143
That guy's crazy.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.307
NO. 1 SEOUL

00:28:20.782 --> 00:28:21.992
Are you okay?

00:28:23.577 --> 00:28:24.578
Yeah.

00:29:52.916 --> 00:29:54.251
Police.

00:29:57.379 --> 00:29:59.423
Please cut the power here,

00:29:59.506 --> 00:30:01.717
and evacuate everyone from this station.

00:30:02.342 --> 00:30:05.387
What about the bomb squad?
Are they on their way?

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:09.141
Ah, they won't be here
for another ten minutes.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.647
All right, folks,
please exit the train quickly.

00:30:15.731 --> 00:30:18.567
We're conducting a brief inspection
due to a safety issue.

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:20.402
This way, okay? This way, please.

00:30:20.485 --> 00:30:24.448
Right this way, yes.
This way please. That's right.

00:30:44.968 --> 00:30:46.636
Try not to breathe so fast.

00:30:47.721 --> 00:30:48.722
What?

00:30:48.805 --> 00:30:52.768
Too much oxygen could end up causing you
to feel lightheaded.

00:30:54.102 --> 00:30:58.482
This bomb is a standard pressure-release
unit, with a timer set as a fail-safe.

00:30:59.024 --> 00:31:00.233
How much time is left?

00:31:01.193 --> 00:31:02.194
Six minutes.

00:31:57.791 --> 00:31:58.792
Look at me.

00:32:01.294 --> 00:32:04.798
The more urgent the mission is,
the more calmly I proceed.

00:32:11.179 --> 00:32:13.390
We're having a normal conversation,
all right?

00:32:23.817 --> 00:32:25.110
Beer.

00:32:26.361 --> 00:32:27.779
If I survive this,

00:32:28.655 --> 00:32:31.283
then the first thing I'll do
is have a cold beer.

00:32:36.121 --> 00:32:37.122
All right.

00:32:37.205 --> 00:32:39.457
First we're gonna switch seats
very carefully,

00:32:39.541 --> 00:32:41.418
and then you're gonna get off this train.

00:32:41.501 --> 00:32:43.211
I want to stay here.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.338
No, you can't stay here.

00:32:46.965 --> 00:32:48.550
You have a crowd waiting for you.

00:32:49.134 --> 00:32:51.761
It doesn't matter. Since I lost my baby…

00:32:58.476 --> 00:32:59.561
I don't have anyone.

00:33:11.239 --> 00:33:14.242
Just follow my lead, okay?

00:33:14.326 --> 00:33:16.036
I promise it won't be difficult.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.366
I'll be out soon.

00:34:22.644 --> 00:34:25.272
- Get out of there!
- It's too dangerous!

00:35:49.814 --> 00:35:52.317
Based on witness accounts
and analysis of CCTV footage

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.612
from inside the train, the police
have identified a man in his forties…

00:35:55.695 --> 00:35:57.781
…congested with passengers
who evacuated the train.

00:35:57.864 --> 00:36:00.241
The explosive device was found installed
under a train seat.

00:36:05.205 --> 00:36:07.082
Have you identified
the suspect?

00:36:07.624 --> 00:36:10.418
We're still tracking him,
but we'll keep you updated.

00:36:11.336 --> 00:36:13.338
So you still don't know who it is?

00:36:13.421 --> 00:36:16.049
For now,
would you all come down to the station

00:36:16.132 --> 00:36:17.759
to give statements?

00:36:17.842 --> 00:36:19.886
You may want to cancel the event.

00:36:19.969 --> 00:36:23.098
It's best to hold off
until after the investigation's complete.

00:36:24.182 --> 00:36:27.102
Continuing today could look like
we're trying too hard.

00:36:27.185 --> 00:36:29.104
And safety comes first.

00:36:29.187 --> 00:36:30.563
Changhee, what do you think?

00:36:33.191 --> 00:36:34.609
Well, I think it should be your call.

00:36:34.693 --> 00:36:36.695
There are no security concerns for now
at the venue.

00:36:36.778 --> 00:36:37.779
Are you…

00:36:38.279 --> 00:36:39.280
I'll keep going.

00:36:39.364 --> 00:36:40.990
This is never gonna be easy,

00:36:41.074 --> 00:36:43.159
and I know you all prepared thoroughly
for today.

00:36:43.243 --> 00:36:45.203
If we have the police escort us,

00:36:45.286 --> 00:36:47.997
I think we can continue my schedule
and head to the last stop tonight.

00:36:48.081 --> 00:36:50.583
Understood. Then we'll proceed as planned.

00:36:51.876 --> 00:36:53.837
I'll ride with Ms. Seo.

00:36:59.551 --> 00:37:01.136
Yes.

00:37:01.219 --> 00:37:05.598
Yes, we're headed to the square now, and
she will announce her campaign as planned.

00:37:06.224 --> 00:37:09.352
Uh-huh. I think that we'll get there
in about 20.

00:37:14.983 --> 00:37:15.984
{\an8}THE NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY

00:37:16.067 --> 00:37:18.319
{\an8}

00:37:21.156 --> 00:37:23.742
Here. Watch your step.

00:37:32.292 --> 00:37:34.002
Candidate has arrived.

00:37:34.085 --> 00:37:35.545
Everyone, stand by.

00:37:35.628 --> 00:37:37.088
Are you sure you're up for this?

00:37:37.172 --> 00:37:38.840
They've been waiting in the cold.

00:37:39.883 --> 00:37:42.802
Why don't you just rest a little?
I don't want you to be nervous out there.

00:37:45.346 --> 00:37:47.557
I don't get nervous talking
to a big crowd.

00:37:55.064 --> 00:37:57.859
You'll see a teleprompter
on both sides of the podium.

00:37:57.942 --> 00:37:58.943
Don't worry.

00:38:09.537 --> 00:38:13.958
Everyone, Candidate Seo Munju, let's
give her a great big round of applause!

00:38:27.305 --> 00:38:31.643
THE NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY

00:38:45.406 --> 00:38:46.825
WE SUPPORT SEO MUNJU

00:38:46.908 --> 00:38:47.992
Keep them back.

00:38:49.244 --> 00:38:50.620
And check what's in their hands.

00:38:53.832 --> 00:38:56.334
- Please! It's a gift!
- No, it's all right.

00:38:59.212 --> 00:39:00.797
Thank you.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.590
We love you, Ms. Seo.

00:39:03.216 --> 00:39:05.844
You have my support.
We know you can do it.

00:39:20.149 --> 00:39:21.609
SEO MUNJU SAVE US

00:39:25.029 --> 00:39:28.825
Many of you here probably don't know
who I am.

00:39:28.908 --> 00:39:31.411
And I imagine that
those of you who do know me

00:39:31.494 --> 00:39:33.705
only know me as the widow of Jang Junik.

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:39.711
Good evening, it's nice to meet you.
I'm Seo Munju, an ambassador.

00:39:46.551 --> 00:39:51.347
You probably heard that I traveled all the
way here today on a train from Gwangju.

00:39:52.015 --> 00:39:55.894
I passed through Daejeon,
bringing with me the warmth of the people,

00:39:55.977 --> 00:39:57.729
and their desire for peace.

00:39:57.812 --> 00:39:59.772
{\an8}But in truth, my journey began
long before that.

00:39:59.856 --> 00:40:01.524
The words she's speaking
are entirely different.

00:40:01.608 --> 00:40:02.734
Want me to cut the teleprompters?

00:40:02.817 --> 00:40:04.569
No, no, leave 'em on for now.

00:40:04.652 --> 00:40:06.905
…my years in America,
studying with the Korean flag

00:40:06.988 --> 00:40:08.239
on the wall above me,

00:40:08.323 --> 00:40:13.661
all the way to the very tragic death
of my husband Jang Junik

00:40:13.745 --> 00:40:15.788
who fought for peace and reunification,

00:40:16.539 --> 00:40:21.002
and up until this day,
when I almost was killed on that train.

00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:24.047
The whole time,
I was running toward this moment.

00:40:24.672 --> 00:40:28.301
And I wondered,
what was that bomb trying to keep me from?

00:40:30.261 --> 00:40:33.014
It was all of you.
I was trying to reach you.

00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:37.435
Some people say I can't be the president
because I'm a woman and a diplomat,

00:40:37.518 --> 00:40:40.438
and I don't have
a traditional political background.

00:40:40.521 --> 00:40:43.775
Some say that I shouldn't be
running for president

00:40:43.858 --> 00:40:46.945
with the party of my late husband.

00:40:47.028 --> 00:40:49.948
And some say I'm not fit
to lead this nation

00:40:50.031 --> 00:40:52.575
because I spent most of my life
out of Korea.

00:40:52.659 --> 00:40:55.787
However, all of you thought
that I could be the one

00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:57.747
to bring change to this great nation.

00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:01.250
That I could help us work
towards peaceful reunification.

00:41:01.334 --> 00:41:07.256
{\an8}That I could be a president for the weak,
the forgotten and the unheard.

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:12.637
And everyone who came out here today:
remember, you are the hope for that unity.

00:41:17.684 --> 00:41:20.103
I don't know why people are trying
to stop us,

00:41:20.186 --> 00:41:24.232
but I know that I'm not afraid, and
I swear that I won't give up this fight,

00:41:24.315 --> 00:41:28.695
as I keep on running towards the goal
for hope and change.

00:41:28.778 --> 00:41:30.196
For peaceful streets,

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:34.158
happy families,
a world where people have each other.

00:41:34.784 --> 00:41:40.039
And also for a nice cold beer to drink
at the end of a long, hard day.

00:41:44.627 --> 00:41:47.171
And to make sure we achieve
all of these things,

00:41:47.755 --> 00:41:53.553
I'd like to announce that I'm a candidate
for the 21st election of the presidency.

00:41:57.140 --> 00:42:02.311
Seo Munju!
Seo Munju! Seo Munju!

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:13.781
Congratulations.

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:16.534
Looks like a superstar is on the rise.

00:42:20.329 --> 00:42:22.665
She just landed her triple axel.

00:42:23.166 --> 00:42:26.044
Seo Munju!
Seo Munju! Seo Munju!

00:42:27.587 --> 00:42:29.213
Did you see that?

00:42:30.465 --> 00:42:31.674
She just slayed it.

00:43:18.805 --> 00:43:20.473
Every night in my dreams…

00:43:22.517 --> 00:43:24.602
I walked as lightly as a leaf.

00:43:26.646 --> 00:43:28.106
And death…

00:43:31.818 --> 00:43:32.819
never scared me.

00:43:34.612 --> 00:43:36.280
But I had no idea…

00:43:38.407 --> 00:43:39.408
that someone…

00:43:43.287 --> 00:43:45.623
had been holding me up this whole time.

00:43:59.679 --> 00:44:04.809
Seo Munju!
Seo Munju! Seo Munju!

00:44:33.546 --> 00:44:35.756
Why did you go back there
from Yongsan?

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:37.466
There are a few more things to work out.

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:39.969
- Where's Ms. Seo?
- She's still talking to those guys.

00:44:40.052 --> 00:44:41.679
- Oh, here she comes.
- There she is.

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:46.475
This is a serious case.
And we need your cooperation, sir.

00:44:47.143 --> 00:44:49.312
Ms. Seo, are you ready to head out?

00:44:49.395 --> 00:44:50.521
Let's go.

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:54.775
- Hello.
- If this how your candidacy is beginning,

00:44:54.859 --> 00:44:56.819
what should we expect as it
gets closer to the election?

00:44:56.903 --> 00:44:58.654
Ambassador Seo, wait, one more question!

00:44:58.738 --> 00:45:00.489
Sir, is there anything…

00:46:30.663 --> 00:46:31.998
Mr. Paik.

00:46:32.623 --> 00:46:34.041
It's been a really long day.

00:46:36.252 --> 00:46:37.503
Is your leg okay?

00:46:40.089 --> 00:46:41.674
Yeah, just a few scratches.

00:46:43.259 --> 00:46:45.136
I don't even know
how to thank you.

00:46:46.053 --> 00:46:47.221
Mr. Paik, I…

00:46:48.472 --> 00:46:50.474
I'm still as confused as I was earlier.

00:46:50.558 --> 00:46:54.353
How did you manage to get to me
at the right time again?

00:46:55.021 --> 00:46:58.441
They killed Assemblyman Jang.
And Father Yang after that.

00:47:00.735 --> 00:47:03.070
I had a feeling that you
would be the next one,

00:47:03.154 --> 00:47:05.156
since you're continuing
the Assemblyman's work.

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.993
If you'd have been hit by that bomb,
you'd have been fatally wounded.

00:47:09.618 --> 00:47:12.663
Someone is attempting
to send you a message.

00:47:12.747 --> 00:47:14.999
That anyone who tries to stop this war…

00:47:16.208 --> 00:47:17.960
is next to meet that same fate.

00:47:19.045 --> 00:47:20.963
You're probably still in danger.

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:24.925
I'll reinforce my security then.

00:47:25.009 --> 00:47:26.886
I don't really think they can manage it.

00:47:27.845 --> 00:47:29.972
Valkyrie just renewed my contract.

00:47:30.056 --> 00:47:33.309
No one is able to protect you
as well as I can Ms. Seo.

00:47:34.226 --> 00:47:37.605
You should hire me as your bodyguard.

00:47:39.815 --> 00:47:41.650
And why should I trust you?

00:47:42.735 --> 00:47:43.944
Do a background check.

00:47:44.028 --> 00:47:47.948
Look into the battles I've fought
and the roles I took on.

00:47:48.032 --> 00:47:50.659
Feel free. Have me followed.

00:47:51.994 --> 00:47:53.662
Why would you do all this?

00:47:54.455 --> 00:47:56.707
Seo Munju, you want to stop this war?

00:47:58.125 --> 00:48:00.628
Well, I do too. Okay?

00:48:02.213 --> 00:48:04.673
Father Yang left me with a task.

00:48:06.509 --> 00:48:08.469
Do you think that I can do it?

00:48:12.264 --> 00:48:13.349
I had this dream.

00:48:14.558 --> 00:48:15.559
And in it,

00:48:17.269 --> 00:48:19.230
I believe that I could do it.

00:48:20.898 --> 00:48:22.566
In my dream I was you.

00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:26.570
But you're gonna need my help.

00:48:30.074 --> 00:48:31.575
Well, my team is…

00:48:31.659 --> 00:48:33.369
They're very meticulous.

00:48:33.452 --> 00:48:35.538
And they will pour over
everything, Mr. Paik.

00:48:35.621 --> 00:48:37.665
Fine. Then I hope that
they can finish it quickly.

00:48:37.748 --> 00:48:42.044
You understand that I'm your boss
and you will follow my instructions.

00:48:42.128 --> 00:48:44.505
Well, every soldier knows
how to take orders.

00:48:44.588 --> 00:48:47.591
However, in case there's an emergency,
you must do as I say.

00:48:48.175 --> 00:48:49.343
And then I'm the boss.

00:48:55.975 --> 00:48:57.226
Okay, Mr. Paik.

00:49:02.815 --> 00:49:03.983
Welcome to the team.

00:49:10.364 --> 00:49:13.826
Thank you, very much. Ms. Seo.

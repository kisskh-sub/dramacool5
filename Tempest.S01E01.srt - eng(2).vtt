00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:27.569
I had a dream.

00:00:40.332 --> 00:00:44.002
And in the dream, I was a man.

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:54.429
He served warm soup to the elderly…

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:58.600
reaching out first…

00:01:01.687 --> 00:01:03.689
hugging first.

00:01:07.943 --> 00:01:09.778
He sang with children…

00:01:10.654 --> 00:01:14.825
My fellow Koreans,
change happens through communication,

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:18.036
making our voices heard.
And in times like this…

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.163
…opened his heart before the world,

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:25.210
and inspired the younger generation.

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:33.594
People would even follow him to war.

00:01:33.677 --> 00:01:35.637
And we have not yet lost hope.

00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:37.764
Together, let's face these challenges!

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:41.685
There was also a woman he loved.

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:05.876
That woman…

00:02:08.462 --> 00:02:10.422
was taking her last breath.

00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:37.282
Munju.

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:42.913
President Hauser
delivered a strong warning

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.540
in response to
North Korea's recent declaration

00:02:45.624 --> 00:02:49.711
to deploy ICBMs
capable of hitting the US mainland.

00:02:51.922 --> 00:02:54.466
Well, obviously, David,
North Korea has crossed the line.

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.386
And, uh, we will not
suffer their belligerence any longer.

00:02:57.928 --> 00:03:01.556
Sadly, uh, peace can only be attained
through strength.

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:03.934
This is how we make the world beautiful.

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:06.853
If North Korea wants to provoke us
with their nukes,

00:03:06.937 --> 00:03:10.232
the United States will have no choice
but to respond in kind.

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:11.900
You got my word on that.

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:14.403
White House spokesperson, Adam Maxwell,

00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:16.154
denied that President Hauser's remarks

00:03:16.238 --> 00:03:19.991
signaled imminent military action
against North Korea.

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:23.078
However, he clarified that
the White House is not limiting

00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:25.831
its considerations to diplomatic
or peaceful solutions,

00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:29.209
while declining to comment
on any specific response measures.

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:32.879
Maxwell went on to state that halting
North Korea's nuclear missile provocations

00:03:32.963 --> 00:03:34.923
remains the administration's top priority,

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:37.968
and that all possible measures
will be pursued in coordination

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:40.262
with allied nations to achieve that goal.

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:44.015
As the United States
dispatched a delegation

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.600
to the Idician capital of Kirus

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:48.770
for cease-fire negotiations
under UN mediation,

00:03:48.854 --> 00:03:52.023
King Anshar Nabu of Idicia
unilaterally announced

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:53.984
the suspension of talks via state media…

00:03:58.447 --> 00:04:00.323
Why did you have me followed?

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:01.992
You know I can't sleep

00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:04.828
when you're out there
running alone so early.

00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:07.873
God knows where you were.

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:09.416
Did you forget how cranky I get

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.126
- when I lose sleep?
- Stop worrying about it.

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.045
It's the one thing I asked for
before coming back here.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.173
Let me do my morning run alone.

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:19.509
It's like morning prayers for me.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.727
Go run, by all means.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.395
I'm not stopping you.

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.481
Just pretend nobody's there following.

00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:36.067
Or if you want, you can just run on
the treadmill, and you'll be all alone.

00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:38.445
I need to run for real.

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:40.155
And I don't want people around.

00:04:41.323 --> 00:04:43.450
Could you pray out loud
with people listening to you?

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:46.328
The only time a politician prays

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:48.747
is when someone's listening.

00:04:58.548 --> 00:04:59.549
Munju.

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:02.761
If someone really wanted to have me
taken down, they could.

00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:06.681
They could run you over while you're
jogging or throw you off of a cliff.

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:08.099
And after that, what's next?

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:11.186
The future of the entire country
is changed forever.

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:13.146
So I want to be careful, okay?

00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:16.525
I'm sorry,
you're not the president, right?

00:05:16.608 --> 00:05:19.402
Let alone a candidate.

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:21.029
Far into the future,

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:24.616
when we look back
and think about what we have done,

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.368
I sincerely hope

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:29.996
that we will be able to say
that we did the right thing

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.165
for the people in North Korea…

00:05:42.884 --> 00:05:43.885
Ms. Seo!

00:05:44.845 --> 00:05:45.846
Ms. Seo!

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:52.727
During her tenure,

00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:54.855
{\an8}Ambassador Seo was a strong advocate
for our nation

00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:58.608
{\an8}in the international community,
engaging in various diplomatic issues.

00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:00.110
{\an8}However, she unexpectedly resigned

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:02.737
{\an8}and returned via
Incheon Airport last night.

00:06:09.578 --> 00:06:12.581
{\an8}Although my three year tenure
as the UN ambassador

00:06:12.664 --> 00:06:13.915
{\an8}was filled with challenges,

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:17.794
{\an8}I was honored to represent my country
on the international stage.

00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:19.921
Seo did however refrain
from commenting on

00:06:20.005 --> 00:06:22.215
the reasons for her sudden resignation.

00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:51.828
TEMPEST

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:05.258
{\an8}PRESIDENT CHAE KYUNGSIN
OF SOUTH KOREA

00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:07.302
{\an8}
What is President Hauser thinking?

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:11.014
{\an8}You know, I've heard this guy
can't even locate Korea on a map.

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:14.059
{\an8}Just ignore him.
Everyone knows he's a nutjob.

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:17.062
{\an8}But who knew Kim Hansang
would turn out worse?

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:19.939
{\an8}He had been so quiet
that people were calling him a recluse,

00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:22.400
{\an8}a hikikomori, they say in Japan.

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:24.319
Now they're competing
to see who's crazier.

00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:27.781
{\an8}In the age of nuclear war,
the lunatic wins.

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:30.742
{\an8}Their leverage is held by the legitimate
fear that they could fire a nuke.

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:32.619
The expats here are losing it.

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:35.622
They're too scared to remain in Korea,
war could break out.

00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:37.916
They'll eventually accept the idea.

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:41.294
New ambassadors get scared
when they first hear news like this,

00:07:41.378 --> 00:07:42.962
packing their bags and calling home.

00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:44.839
But after a while they get used to it.

00:07:44.923 --> 00:07:47.967
They sleep at night, like the rest of us.

00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:49.219
You know?

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:53.306
Actually, I was up all night.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:54.891
And why's that?

00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:58.436
They talk about Hansang
on the news all day in the States.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.440
{\an8}The Iraq War, the Idicia War.
It was propaganda that started those.

00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:03.942
{\an8}The US…

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:05.443
{\an8}They're still stuck in the Middle East

00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:08.279
{\an8}because they can't seem to bring an end
to the Idicia War.

00:08:08.363 --> 00:08:10.532
I doubt it's another war they're planning.

00:08:11.783 --> 00:08:13.368
Speaking of which,

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:15.870
tell us the real reason you resigned.

00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:18.206
Come on, you know!

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:21.334
Her husband's the opposition's
front-runner for the president this year.

00:08:21.418 --> 00:08:22.419
Yeah, I know.

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:24.337
But what I'm wondering is

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:28.258
if it was the ambassador's idea
or the president's.

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:30.301
Oh, here she is.

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:34.347
Good afternoon, Madam President.

00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:36.266
- Honor to meet you, Madam President.
- It's an honor.

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:38.601
I'm sorry to drag her away.

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:40.520
Could I just borrow her a while?

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:43.022
You didn't have to answer
all their questions.

00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:46.526
You could've just said I told you
to either quit or divorce your husband

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:47.861
since he's about to become president.

00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:50.363
Sorry if I caused you any trouble.

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:53.533
When you got North Korea,
China, and the US,

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:57.203
each with their own
special brand of crazy,

00:08:57.287 --> 00:09:01.958
to agree on the word "peacefully"
in the Basel Quadripartite Agreement,

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.168
I thought,

00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:06.421
"Wow, if I am the next president,

00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:09.007
I hope she'll help me
deal with foreign affairs."

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:12.510
Only, then I found out
who you were married to,

00:09:12.594 --> 00:09:15.096
and… …I was heartbroken.

00:09:16.097 --> 00:09:18.349
Still, we've worked together for a decade.

00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:20.810
And I've appreciated it.

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:22.979
But when you turned down
the minister position,

00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:28.693
I had a feeling Jang Junik
was going to be running for president.

00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:38.036
I wanted the ambassador position

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:41.247
to deal with North Korea's nuclear issue,
like you have.

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:45.251
Putting aside everything else,

00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:49.464
his views on reunification
are risky at best.

00:09:49.547 --> 00:09:51.716
- He's still figuring it out.
- Do you know why?

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.928
Because he doesn't care.

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:57.597
The policy that his campaign
first introduced

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.307
was the Social Isolation initiative.

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.351
Then climate, and food, and agriculture.

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:02.936
After that, gender.

00:10:05.897 --> 00:10:08.316
And when is he going to discuss…

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:09.651
inter-Korean relations?

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:10.860
The North could fall any day,

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:13.238
and most young people oppose reunifying.

00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:16.282
Last year Jang was a star, after he said,

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:18.701
"If it requires
South Korea being sacrificed,

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:21.538
reunification isn't desirable
or necessary."

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:24.999
He even said that we should consider
a constitutional revision

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:27.585
to split Korea into separate nations.

00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:32.340
Even a young politician,
going for the cool factor.

00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:34.425
Should know better, right?

00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:37.095
Reunification issues…

00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:40.723
will hit us suddenly,

00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:44.519
like some inevitable disaster.

00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:47.772
I wanted to tell you,

00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:51.276
he's attending a mass
for reunification today.

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:54.821
He says he has an announcement
to make when the service is done.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.908
Regarding the reunification?

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:02.871
Madam President…

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:08.334
No matter how late,
Junik wants to speak with you today.

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:09.961
He said that?

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:12.005
Why?

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:14.299
He hasn't told me. Not yet at least.

00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:16.968
I understand.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.140
Yes, I've been ready for this.

00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:33.610
Sorry.
This work thing came out of nowhere.

00:11:34.152 --> 00:11:36.362
Will you please
tell your folks I apologize?

00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:38.156
No, I'm the one who's sorry.

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:41.868
I would have canceled my appointment here
if you had let me know.

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:44.746
Tonight was also important to me.

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:46.080
You've worked so hard,

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:47.874
and I've wanted to tell your parents

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:50.251
what a great job you've been doing
in the States.

00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:51.502
You see, um…

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:57.258
I was prepared to follow you wherever
you had to go as your personal aide.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.930
So I closed out all my savings accounts
and then I…

00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:04.974
was ready to leave whenever you'd call.

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:07.268
Sudan, Syria, Iraq…

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:11.439
I really didn't care if it was the most
dangerous place in the whole entire earth.

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:15.235
Except of course, there's one place
I never, ever want to go.

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:17.153
The New Republicans.

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:20.406
Yeah, your husband's the
New Republican Party's top candidate.

00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:24.869
I just can't work for that party
in any capacity, I can't do it.

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:25.954
Yeah.

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:30.375
When you're married you…

00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:32.418
accept your husband's weakness
as your own.

00:12:33.002 --> 00:12:34.879
Is this really what you want to do?

00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:38.174
Junik will run for president
regardless of how I feel.

00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:42.220
So if he wants this,
then it's better I stay by his side.

00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:46.808
Your political career
is going to end if you do.

00:12:57.652 --> 00:12:59.028
What's this?

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:04.909
I really needed you.

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:08.246
Thanks for coming back, Munju.

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:14.627
It's pretty.

00:13:15.586 --> 00:13:16.838
What's with the cross?

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:20.425
I hear it's the most popular design

00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:22.093
for two thousand years now.

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:25.888
You want me to wear this
to the church later?

00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:29.058
A picture of you praying
with that necklace on would be incredible,

00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:30.560
don't you think?

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:33.187
You want me to pray now, too?

00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:35.273
I think I could do all right…

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:37.525
if you would pray for me.

00:13:38.192 --> 00:13:40.862
You want me to pray
that you'll be president?

00:13:57.628 --> 00:13:59.297
Pray that I handle the challenges,

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:02.258
although I can be weak at times.

00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:11.392
You called and asked
that I come back last month.

00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:15.938
I could tell in your voice
something was wrong.

00:14:19.484 --> 00:14:20.902
What's going on?

00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:23.071
Why won't you just tell me?

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:27.658
Why don't we talk tonight?

00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:30.703
To be honest, it's a long story.

00:14:51.682 --> 00:14:54.852
The two of you will sit right here,
with security here--

00:14:54.936 --> 00:14:56.604
Let's keep them out of the church.

00:14:57.105 --> 00:15:00.066
- I'm sorry?
- Well, it is a mass for peace, isn't it?

00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:01.943
A lot of important people will be there.

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:06.447
I don't want it to look like I'm scared
in the house of God.

00:15:07.615 --> 00:15:08.908
Keep them out of sight.

00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:12.245
But, sir, I think…

00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:14.163
Should we get some peaches later?

00:15:19.836 --> 00:15:21.129
Peaches this time of year?

00:15:22.713 --> 00:15:24.090
You'll get some, right?

00:15:24.173 --> 00:15:26.843
I thought you didn't like peaches.

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:29.679
Well, suddenly I'm craving them.

00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:41.023
No peaceful reunification!

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:43.192
No peaceful reunification!

00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:45.069
Eliminate the traitors!

00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:47.155
Eliminate the traitors!

00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:49.365
No peaceful reunification!

00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:51.784
No peaceful reunification!

00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:53.411
Eliminate the traitors!

00:15:53.494 --> 00:15:54.954
Eliminate the traitors!

00:15:55.913 --> 00:15:58.040
No peaceful reunification!

00:15:58.124 --> 00:15:59.834
We're here at
Peace and Forgiveness Church,

00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:02.295
where a mass for peaceful
reunification will be held.

00:16:02.378 --> 00:16:03.921
The mass, scheduled to begin shortly,

00:16:04.005 --> 00:16:06.924
will be attended by prominent figures
from several fields.

00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:08.467
It's generating a lot of buzz

00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:11.179
because Assemblyman Jang Junik
of the New Republican Party,

00:16:11.262 --> 00:16:14.140
known for opposing reunification,
is attending.

00:16:14.223 --> 00:16:15.766
No peaceful reunification!

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.393
Eliminate the traitors!

00:16:17.476 --> 00:16:19.395
Eliminate the traitors!

00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:21.898
History repeats itself!

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:24.233
Jang Junik must step down!

00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:26.736
Step down! Step down!

00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:28.362
Eliminate the traitors!

00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:31.616
{\an8}DESTRUCTION OF COMMUNISM IS
THE ONLY WAY FOR REUNIFICATION

00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:35.828
History repeats itself!
Jang Junik must step down!

00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:38.247
Step down! Step down!

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:42.835
- No peaceful reunification!
- No peaceful reunification!

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:45.713
- Eliminate the traitors!
- Eliminate the traitors!

00:16:45.796 --> 00:16:47.381
REUNIFICATION IS HELL

00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:50.551
- No peaceful reunification!
- No peaceful reunification!

00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:53.846
- No peaceful reunification!
- No peaceful reunification!

00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:03.374
Have the security team wait outside.

00:18:03.457 --> 00:18:07.461
And Changhee, find a safe place
for Munju to stay for a while, okay?

00:18:08.462 --> 00:18:10.715
Make sure it's ready
so she can head straight there.

00:18:11.382 --> 00:18:12.383
Right away, sir.

00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:36.365
ENTRANCE HYMN
THE LITTLE TREE BOYS CHOIR

00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:39.827
What's that?

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.078
Nothing.

00:18:48.044 --> 00:18:49.462
Let us pray.

00:18:50.004 --> 00:18:52.590
Almighty and eternal God,

00:18:52.673 --> 00:18:57.219
please have mercy on this nation
divided into North and South.

00:18:57.303 --> 00:19:00.765
And bring peace and forgiveness
to our land.

00:19:00.848 --> 00:19:02.224
Amen.

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:04.143
Amen.

00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:07.480
"Wake up."

00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:11.525
"But if you do not wake up,
I will come like a thief,

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:16.947
and you will not know
at what time I will come to you."

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:19.492
This is the word of the Lord.

00:19:20.242 --> 00:19:22.286
Let us all stand.

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:38.511
♪ Hallelujah, hallelujah ♪

00:19:40.346 --> 00:19:45.142
♪ Hallelujah ♪

00:19:48.229 --> 00:19:49.814
Assemblyman Jang!

00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:58.572
Why would you betray us?

00:20:02.076 --> 00:20:03.327
You swore not to reunify.

00:20:11.961 --> 00:20:13.295
No! No!

00:20:14.755 --> 00:20:16.090
Oh, honey, sweetie!

00:20:16.173 --> 00:20:17.758
You'll be okay!

00:20:20.177 --> 00:20:21.303
Mr. Jang!

00:20:26.142 --> 00:20:27.727
You're going to be okay, Junik.

00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:37.486
"No peaceful reunification"?

00:20:40.614 --> 00:20:41.824
REUNIFICATION IS HELL

00:20:45.411 --> 00:20:46.829
I'll convince him.

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:51.459
Sergeant Kim Yongjun.

00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:54.879
Drop the gun.

00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:03.512
Go in!

00:21:09.643 --> 00:21:10.853
Sweetie.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.651
You're okay.

00:21:22.573 --> 00:21:25.075
Our…

00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:28.162
peaches…

00:22:07.284 --> 00:22:09.703
Junik.

00:22:09.787 --> 00:22:10.955
Junik!

00:22:11.664 --> 00:22:13.499
Junik! Honey!

00:22:13.582 --> 00:22:15.125
No, sweetie!

00:22:58.878 --> 00:23:02.464
{\an8}BREAKING NEWS: JANG JUNIK SHOT…

news that Assemblyman Jang Junik

00:23:05.301 --> 00:23:07.136

{\an8}where Assemblyman Jang Junik
is undergoing emergency surgery.

00:23:14.768 --> 00:23:16.020
{\an8}His family, including his mother,

{\an8}Chairwoman Lim Okseon
of Aseom Shipping, has just arrived.

00:23:19.398 --> 00:23:22.234
{\an8}Aseom Shipping,

00:23:22.318 --> 00:23:23.986
{\an8}operates over a hundred vessels,

00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:26.739
{\an8}as well as a global network
of logistics facilities.

00:23:26.822 --> 00:23:28.490
{\an8}-
Uh, yes, hello.

00:23:28.574 --> 00:23:30.492
{\an8}I have a flight to Washington DC
scheduled tomorrow

00:23:30.576 --> 00:23:31.952
{\an8}that I'm gonna have to cancel.

00:23:32.036 --> 00:23:34.079
The suspect, Kim,
a 27-year-old man,

00:23:34.163 --> 00:23:35.497
with a military background

00:23:35.581 --> 00:23:38.500
is known to be involved
with an anti-reunification group.

00:23:49.219 --> 00:23:51.055
OPERATING ROOM 1

00:23:51.805 --> 00:23:53.641
He's coming out.

00:24:01.857 --> 00:24:05.319
Mr. Jang Junik passed away
tonight due to excessive blood loss.

00:24:05.402 --> 00:24:07.696
His time of death was 9:15 p.m.

00:24:10.115 --> 00:24:11.200
Oh, God.

00:24:15.829 --> 00:24:17.164
Are you okay?

00:24:17.247 --> 00:24:18.290
Let's get you out of here.

00:24:26.256 --> 00:24:27.299
{\an8}Breaking news.

00:24:27.383 --> 00:24:29.927
{\an8}Assemblyman Jang Junik,
who was shot during the mass

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:32.721
{\an8}and rushed into emergency surgery,
tragically passed away

00:24:32.805 --> 00:24:34.723
{\an8}- at 9:15 p.m. tonight.

00:24:40.062 --> 00:24:41.855
{\an8}BREAKING NEWS:
ASSEMBLYMAN JANG JUNIK

00:24:41.939 --> 00:24:43.607
{\an8}OF NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY
ASSASSINATED

00:25:13.762 --> 00:25:16.515
Following the sudden death
of Assemblyman Jang Junik,

00:25:16.598 --> 00:25:18.809
the political sphere remains in turmoil.

00:25:18.892 --> 00:25:21.020
The New Republican Party
is discussing countermeasures

00:25:21.103 --> 00:25:22.229
after losing its candidate.

00:25:22.312 --> 00:25:25.399
And it seems changes to
the primary schedule are unavoidable.

00:25:32.448 --> 00:25:37.870
My husband is dead, my son is dead,
and now my grandson's dead.

00:25:37.953 --> 00:25:40.664
I guess we'll have three widows
living under one roof.

00:25:44.334 --> 00:25:45.961
You're not alone, Grandma, okay?

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:48.505
When my son died,

00:25:49.006 --> 00:25:52.009
I resented you for being alive, Okseon.

00:25:53.093 --> 00:25:55.304
You understand my pain now, don't you?

00:25:58.849 --> 00:26:02.728
Now you have to watch your son's widow,
who didn't even give him a child,

00:26:02.811 --> 00:26:04.396
enjoy his inheritance.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.689
You're right, Mother.

00:26:06.982 --> 00:26:08.358
When my husband was sick,

00:26:08.442 --> 00:26:12.279
you made sure that our oldest son
got everything instead of me.

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:16.116
Which only served you in the end.

00:26:17.743 --> 00:26:19.328
How was I to know?

00:26:21.497 --> 00:26:25.375
Grandma, Mother, Munju.

00:26:28.128 --> 00:26:29.713
I know it's not the best time to tell you,

00:26:30.214 --> 00:26:33.300
but I've decided to run for president
in Junik's place.

00:26:36.762 --> 00:26:38.097
You're going to do what?

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:41.934
The party's approval ratings
since Junik's death

00:26:42.476 --> 00:26:44.937
are the highest they've been
since its founding.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.106
Someone has to take his place.

00:26:47.189 --> 00:26:50.025
And the party believes
I'm the right person for the job.

00:26:50.109 --> 00:26:53.654
According to the most recent polling,
I'm likely to win…

00:26:54.988 --> 00:26:56.448
by a landslide, actually.

00:26:58.158 --> 00:26:59.451
Who's been telling you this?

00:27:00.744 --> 00:27:02.371
Hwang Mangi, the party leader.

00:27:08.502 --> 00:27:09.503
I always knew…

00:27:10.879 --> 00:27:13.173
there'd be snakes with Junik's death.

00:27:14.133 --> 00:27:16.260
I expected that from Hwang Mangi.

00:27:17.636 --> 00:27:20.305
But you, my own son?

00:27:21.431 --> 00:27:22.766
So you don't think…

00:27:24.393 --> 00:27:25.477
I have what it takes?

00:27:25.561 --> 00:27:28.647
Junsang, you're best as a prosecutor.

00:27:30.023 --> 00:27:32.192
If anyone takes his place in the election,

00:27:32.276 --> 00:27:33.527
it should be Munju.

00:27:35.529 --> 00:27:37.573
Okseon. What are you saying?

00:27:37.656 --> 00:27:40.742
There's something called
a widow's succession in American politics.

00:27:40.826 --> 00:27:43.453
People will always
vote for a politician's widow.

00:27:44.413 --> 00:27:45.622
That's how we win this.

00:27:45.706 --> 00:27:47.374
You think I'll lose…

00:27:49.877 --> 00:27:51.086
but Munju will win?

00:27:59.011 --> 00:28:01.680
Sorry I'm late.
The review took longer than expected.

00:28:01.763 --> 00:28:02.890
Oh, I'm glad you're here.

00:28:02.973 --> 00:28:05.976
I thought I would choke from how
uncomfortable this has become.

00:28:07.477 --> 00:28:11.815
The late Assemblyman Jang Junik
personally hired a lawyer two weeks ago

00:28:11.899 --> 00:28:14.067
to handle arrangements for his estate.

00:28:14.151 --> 00:28:16.361
I only received the details yesterday.

00:28:23.368 --> 00:28:25.078
STATEMENT OF THE GIFTED PROPERTY

00:28:25.162 --> 00:28:29.625
He left a total of 4,410,550,090 won

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.461
to Ms. Seo Munju, his wife.

00:28:32.961 --> 00:28:36.798
He also left five real estate properties
worth a total of 28 billion won

00:28:36.882 --> 00:28:37.883
to Seo Munju.

00:28:37.966 --> 00:28:40.761
His tangible assets worth 5.5 billion…

00:28:40.844 --> 00:28:41.887
BENEFICIARY
SEO MUNJU

00:28:42.763 --> 00:28:45.515
- …he left to her as well.
- Look, stop complicating this.

00:28:45.599 --> 00:28:49.019
Just tell us
what do we get after her share?

00:28:49.102 --> 00:28:51.271
I have yet to receive the details
to his overseas assets,

00:28:51.355 --> 00:28:52.940
so I can't say for sure,

00:28:53.982 --> 00:28:56.318
but I don't think there's anything left.

00:28:56.401 --> 00:28:59.237
That's absurd. It's just nonsense.

00:28:59.321 --> 00:29:02.240
How do you know this wasn't forged,
or if that lawyer is a fraud?

00:29:02.824 --> 00:29:05.118
It's been confirmed
that each of the transfers

00:29:05.202 --> 00:29:07.746
was legitimate and-and legally valid.

00:29:07.829 --> 00:29:10.540
The Jang family started by selling salt.

00:29:10.624 --> 00:29:13.835
We built this fortune
over three generations of hard work.

00:29:13.919 --> 00:29:16.171
There's no way that girl
who came into this family

00:29:16.254 --> 00:29:18.465
with no home or status
has any claim to it!

00:29:20.342 --> 00:29:21.343
Go ahead.

00:29:22.219 --> 00:29:24.846
I want an explanation. What's is all this?

00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:27.724
I have no idea.

00:29:28.225 --> 00:29:30.727
Look, I'm as surprised as all of you.

00:29:30.811 --> 00:29:32.604
He said he'd sort out his assets

00:29:32.688 --> 00:29:35.482
and that I should
turn in my ID to a lawyer.

00:29:35.565 --> 00:29:37.150
You see, I told you.

00:29:37.234 --> 00:29:39.903
You never should have let him
marry such worthless trash.

00:29:39.987 --> 00:29:42.030
Grandma, don't start this again.

00:29:42.114 --> 00:29:44.408
You couldn't even give him a child.

00:29:45.575 --> 00:29:46.910
Why not?

00:29:46.994 --> 00:29:49.538
He spent every night alone because of you.

00:29:49.621 --> 00:29:51.248
Mother, would you please stop!

00:29:55.919 --> 00:29:57.546
And you, be honest with us.

00:29:59.172 --> 00:30:01.216
You had to know people would gossip.

00:30:01.299 --> 00:30:03.301
They'll think you killed Junik for money.

00:30:03.385 --> 00:30:05.846
A woman who had nothing
before she was married

00:30:05.929 --> 00:30:08.640
becomes a widow right after
her husband gives her everything.

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:11.476
How do you explain that?

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.438
Who would give away
their entire fortune for no reason?

00:30:14.521 --> 00:30:16.148
And you didn't know anything about it?

00:30:17.357 --> 00:30:19.735
After sitting here
with you and Grandmother tonight…

00:30:20.777 --> 00:30:23.113
I can understand
why he left me everything.

00:30:24.281 --> 00:30:25.532
Grandmother.

00:30:27.659 --> 00:30:29.619
I am not worthless trash.

00:30:30.162 --> 00:30:33.206
I had a mother who gave everything
to raise me with love and care.

00:30:36.501 --> 00:30:40.297
You always treated me like I was a beggar
and I just ignored it.

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.299
My mother taught me not to feel inferior

00:30:42.382 --> 00:30:45.218
and to never be ashamed of who I am
or where I'm from.

00:30:47.429 --> 00:30:49.097
I guess Junik couldn't stand it.

00:30:49.181 --> 00:30:52.517
He left me all his money
so you wouldn't look down on me anymore.

00:30:52.601 --> 00:30:55.479
My goodness, look at her face.
See how she's glaring at us.

00:30:55.562 --> 00:30:57.773
If you truly loved Junik so much…

00:30:57.856 --> 00:31:00.734
…why didn't you shed
a single tear at his funeral?

00:31:01.318 --> 00:31:03.278
I always had a feeling, you know?

00:31:03.361 --> 00:31:05.363
There's something wrong with you.

00:31:07.783 --> 00:31:08.909
I get it now.

00:31:11.203 --> 00:31:12.746
Junik was just angry

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:16.416
with all of us for how…
how we treated you, correct?

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:19.795
And this is him expressing
that resentment.

00:31:21.963 --> 00:31:22.964
But

00:31:24.091 --> 00:31:27.052
this whole thing feels like
some kind of cruel joke.

00:31:28.887 --> 00:31:30.347
I didn't have it easy here.

00:31:30.931 --> 00:31:34.601
Still, I endured and helped
this family grow its fortune.

00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:42.734
Every piece of land and property you
inherited has my fingerprints all over it.

00:31:44.069 --> 00:31:48.490
But above all, I poured my heart
and soul into raising my son.

00:31:49.074 --> 00:31:52.202
It's like tending to a tree
through a storm,

00:31:52.786 --> 00:31:55.455
and then waiting for it
to bear fruit after so long,

00:31:55.956 --> 00:31:58.458
only to lose it just before the harvest.

00:31:58.542 --> 00:31:59.960
Try to imagine

00:32:00.585 --> 00:32:02.129
what that feels like.

00:32:05.382 --> 00:32:06.842
I'm not accepting this.

00:32:07.801 --> 00:32:09.553
Losing Junik ripped out my heart.

00:32:09.636 --> 00:32:12.139
And now I'm supposed to watch you
take everything that's left of him?

00:32:12.222 --> 00:32:14.724
It took three generations
to build your wealth.

00:32:14.808 --> 00:32:15.809
And I don't want it.

00:32:16.643 --> 00:32:19.813
- I'll donate everything and leave Korea.
- Who says it's yours to donate?

00:32:19.896 --> 00:32:23.984
- You're not going anywhere.
- We should sue, all right?

00:32:24.568 --> 00:32:28.488
First off, we'll file an injunction
to freeze all of the assets,

00:32:28.572 --> 00:32:31.867
and then a claim for the return
of the statutory share of the inheritance.

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:33.493
None of this adds up.

00:32:33.577 --> 00:32:34.578
Got it?

00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:38.415
Get the best lawyers you can.
The cost is irrelevant.

00:32:38.498 --> 00:32:39.624
Very well.

00:32:40.834 --> 00:32:43.003
This isn't about the money for me either.

00:32:43.587 --> 00:32:45.797
It's about the pride I have as a mother.

00:32:46.298 --> 00:32:47.757
And I'm going to fight until the end.

00:32:47.841 --> 00:32:52.345
I'll file endless lawsuits,
and ensure you'll never get anything.

00:32:52.429 --> 00:32:54.139
Do whatever you want.

00:32:54.222 --> 00:32:55.432
I'm not afraid of you.

00:32:57.684 --> 00:33:00.437
I want everyone here early tomorrow.
There's a lot of work to do.

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:01.688
Yes, ma'am.

00:33:01.771 --> 00:33:05.775
Ah, you're meeting here at my house again?

00:33:08.069 --> 00:33:11.281
I'm sorry,
since when does she own this house?

00:33:13.617 --> 00:33:15.368
Since ten days ago.

00:33:15.452 --> 00:33:17.662
Don't worry, Grandmother.

00:33:17.746 --> 00:33:19.789
I'm not as cruel as you think I am.

00:33:25.295 --> 00:33:30.508
Munju. The best way to handle a lawsuit
is to not get involved in one.

00:33:31.218 --> 00:33:34.596
People will talk,
and no one walks away without being hurt.

00:33:35.347 --> 00:33:37.891
I know you're uncomfortable

00:33:39.851 --> 00:33:42.771
- with having all this inheritance.
- No, it's okay.

00:33:43.355 --> 00:33:46.608
The only ones who get hurt
in lawsuits are the ones in the wrong.

00:33:46.691 --> 00:33:49.402
Grandmother will…

00:33:49.486 --> 00:33:52.364
Listen, they won't
just go after the money.

00:33:52.447 --> 00:33:55.492
They'll try to break your soul,
down to the last piece.

00:34:04.668 --> 00:34:06.670
I've always wanted to help you out.

00:34:08.088 --> 00:34:10.090
Trust me, let's end this on good terms.

00:34:11.925 --> 00:34:16.137
And if you really want to donate it,
how about contributing to my election?

00:34:16.930 --> 00:34:20.267
If you and I team up, we could have
the most incredible synergy…

00:34:21.309 --> 00:34:23.311
I'd prefer if you just sued me.

00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:09.816
INTERNATIONAL CALL

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.403
Mark? Hey, you there? It's Ethan.

00:35:13.486 --> 00:35:15.071
How did you get my number?

00:35:15.155 --> 00:35:18.074
It's nice to hear your voice too, buddy.
I've got a job for you.

00:35:18.158 --> 00:35:19.534
I'm done with that.

00:35:19.618 --> 00:35:21.077
Mmm, you sure?

00:35:21.161 --> 00:35:25.373
It's a big one, like Swiss-account big.
And the client says it's got to be you.

00:35:25.457 --> 00:35:27.208
{\an8}It's a security detail.

00:35:27.292 --> 00:35:31.129
Widow of a South Korean politician,
name of Munju Seo.

00:35:39.846 --> 00:35:41.306
She's the client?

00:35:41.389 --> 00:35:44.184
No, Seo doesn't even know she's in danger.

00:35:44.934 --> 00:35:48.271
Our client wants you to be her bodyguard,
but keep it a secret.

00:35:48.897 --> 00:35:50.315
What does that mean?

00:35:50.398 --> 00:35:53.151
Well, it means she needs to think
hiring you was her idea.

00:35:53.234 --> 00:35:55.195
You can't disclose anything
about our client

00:35:56.112 --> 00:35:59.741
and they want some intel on her,
who she meets, what they're talking about…

00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:09.834
His name was Kim Yongjun, 27 years old.
He was with the Special Warfare Command.

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:14.005
I can tell you the guy was a nutcase.
But one with a cause. You know the type.

00:36:14.964 --> 00:36:16.383
I went to check out his place,

00:36:16.466 --> 00:36:19.094
and he had tons of photos
and information on Mr. Jang Junik.

00:36:19.177 --> 00:36:21.346
I think he got angry
when Mr. Jang's actions

00:36:21.429 --> 00:36:23.306
didn't line up with what he expected.

00:36:23.807 --> 00:36:24.849
Did he have any family?

00:36:24.933 --> 00:36:28.687
One older sister and a father,
but his sister got married and moved out.

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:31.064
And his father is deaf
and can't communicate.

00:36:31.147 --> 00:36:34.067
People like him all have one thing
in common. They're loners.

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:36.903
And the anti-reunification group
didn't seem to know who he was.

00:36:36.986 --> 00:36:39.572
So they'll probably conclude
he acted alone.

00:36:40.323 --> 00:36:41.908
What about that man?

00:36:41.991 --> 00:36:43.451
The one from the church.

00:36:44.035 --> 00:36:45.829
Oh, Mark Paik?

00:36:45.912 --> 00:36:46.955
Mr. Paik Sanho.

00:36:47.455 --> 00:36:49.749
People at the church say
he's a North Korean defector,

00:36:49.833 --> 00:36:51.501
his neighbors say he's from Yanbian,

00:36:51.584 --> 00:36:54.045
and his co-workers say he's from Russia.

00:36:54.129 --> 00:36:56.297
But from what we've found,
he's actually American.

00:36:56.381 --> 00:36:57.924
We've been looking all over
for him just to

00:36:58.007 --> 00:37:00.552
get his witness statement,
but we can't find him.

00:37:00.635 --> 00:37:02.345
I don't believe he just disappeared.

00:37:03.054 --> 00:37:05.765
Oh, honey! Sweetie, you'll be okay.

00:37:06.725 --> 00:37:09.936
Why not?
He spent every night alone because of you!

00:37:10.019 --> 00:37:12.731
A woman who had nothing
before she was married

00:37:13.314 --> 00:37:16.359
becomes a widow right after
her husband gives her everything?

00:37:25.577 --> 00:37:27.203
Thanks for coming back, Munju.

00:37:35.628 --> 00:37:37.797
I've been watching her.

00:37:37.881 --> 00:37:40.383
She experienced a serious trauma, but…

00:37:45.138 --> 00:37:47.265
she hides her emotions well.

00:37:52.937 --> 00:37:55.815
She still maintains her daily routine,

00:37:56.816 --> 00:37:58.193
stays incredibly busy,

00:37:59.569 --> 00:38:01.154
not interested in eating.

00:38:08.578 --> 00:38:09.662
And also,

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:12.373
a little careless.

00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:33.895
But she has no idea that she's in danger.

00:38:36.773 --> 00:38:39.150
So,
you had your little investigation.

00:38:39.234 --> 00:38:41.152
What's it going to be? You taking the job?

00:38:41.236 --> 00:38:42.237
No.

00:38:43.863 --> 00:38:44.989
Not interested.

00:38:45.657 --> 00:38:47.951
I don't see a need to be involved here.

00:38:51.704 --> 00:38:53.081
She seems strong.

00:38:55.667 --> 00:38:57.252
Stronger than you would think.

00:39:17.856 --> 00:39:19.732
You're Munju, right?

00:39:20.608 --> 00:39:22.235
Your husband, Junik,

00:39:23.528 --> 00:39:26.573
visited here the day before he passed.

00:39:26.656 --> 00:39:28.992
Confessed to all of his sins.

00:39:30.285 --> 00:39:32.871
and was forgiven for all of it.

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:37.125
I got baptized
when I was married 20 years ago.

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:41.337
I've been wanting to leave the church,

00:39:41.421 --> 00:39:43.756
but the Catholic Church
has no way to do that.

00:39:44.507 --> 00:39:46.509
After my husband's death…

00:39:48.845 --> 00:39:50.638
I lost him recently,

00:39:50.722 --> 00:39:52.765
so I'm allowed to be honest,
right, Father?

00:39:52.849 --> 00:39:55.643
Junik always believed in this place.

00:39:56.477 --> 00:39:58.813
He said the house of God
was the safest place.

00:39:59.355 --> 00:40:02.567
But if this really was the house of God,

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:06.571
then he allowed one of his guests
to be killed inside of it.

00:40:08.406 --> 00:40:10.283
If God were a human, Father,

00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:14.287
I'd call him a monster.
A monster or a psychopath.

00:40:14.996 --> 00:40:17.290
Except that's a blasphemous thing to say.

00:40:18.791 --> 00:40:22.712
So I think that, respectfully,
I'll choose not to believe in him.

00:40:27.383 --> 00:40:28.384
At times like this,

00:40:29.761 --> 00:40:31.930
I can't help but think about Job,

00:40:32.764 --> 00:40:36.851
a man who went through
so much suffering for no reason.

00:40:36.935 --> 00:40:39.938
Don't tell me I'll understand
the meaning of this one day, Father.

00:40:40.855 --> 00:40:45.276
That's the kind of thing people say
when you lose a baby.

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:47.195
The devil himself

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:50.865
is responsible for this.

00:40:54.327 --> 00:40:55.620
I felt the pain

00:40:57.413 --> 00:41:00.416
of losing my whole family
right before my eyes.

00:41:01.584 --> 00:41:04.837
And 70 years later,
the meaning of it still evades me.

00:41:04.921 --> 00:41:07.465
So I won't tell you anything like that.

00:41:07.548 --> 00:41:08.758
However,

00:41:09.926 --> 00:41:13.137
Job saw the face of God
in the middle of a storm.

00:41:14.806 --> 00:41:17.433
Munju… Sorry, Ms. Seo.

00:41:18.393 --> 00:41:20.561
A storm is heading towards us.

00:41:20.645 --> 00:41:23.022
And when the time comes,
you will have a question

00:41:23.106 --> 00:41:24.816
to ask him desperately.

00:41:25.483 --> 00:41:26.526
Then…

00:41:28.528 --> 00:41:30.071
come and talk to me.

00:41:32.073 --> 00:41:35.410
In the meantime, remember,
I'll be praying for you.

00:41:37.286 --> 00:41:38.830
Mr. Paik Sanho.

00:41:41.791 --> 00:41:43.668
I came here to speak to him.

00:41:46.254 --> 00:41:47.505
Could you tell him

00:41:48.965 --> 00:41:50.466
that I came looking?

00:42:28.296 --> 00:42:29.297
Paik Sanho, right?

00:42:33.468 --> 00:42:34.677
I'm really sorry

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:36.929
about your husband.

00:42:56.866 --> 00:42:59.202
He looks like the guy
who was at the church.

00:42:59.994 --> 00:43:02.038
The American, Paik Sanho.

00:43:04.248 --> 00:43:05.416
Let the boss know.

00:43:09.128 --> 00:43:11.798
- I need to ask you something.
- Are you aware someone's trailing you?

00:43:16.052 --> 00:43:17.386
Let's talk somewhere else.

00:43:21.015 --> 00:43:23.351
- I think they're onto us.
- Follow them. This is Team 1.

00:43:23.434 --> 00:43:24.435
The target's in pursuit.

00:43:36.989 --> 00:43:40.201
- Ms. Seo, stop please.
- Keep walking.

00:43:40.284 --> 00:43:42.370
Could you stop for a moment? Ms. Seo?

00:44:23.661 --> 00:44:25.454
Close your eyes and then open them.

00:44:52.857 --> 00:44:54.775
Seoul is a very well-lit city.

00:44:55.359 --> 00:44:57.570
Those guys will never be able to catch us.

00:44:57.653 --> 00:45:00.198
They don't know how
to operate in the dark.

00:45:09.832 --> 00:45:12.752
You're keeping up pretty well,
for someone from the city.

00:45:16.672 --> 00:45:18.507
Are you familiar with these mountains?

00:45:20.092 --> 00:45:21.636
I know every mountain in Seoul,

00:45:21.719 --> 00:45:24.972
all the waterways, underground passages,
abandoned buildings…

00:45:25.056 --> 00:45:27.016
Basically anything that's not on the map.

00:45:27.475 --> 00:45:30.978
For people like me, the first thing we do
is figure out escape routes,

00:45:31.062 --> 00:45:32.146
places to hide,

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:34.732
and where to stay the night,
should the reason arise.

00:45:35.983 --> 00:45:38.444
What exactly do you mean,
"people like you"?

00:45:39.528 --> 00:45:41.364
Someone who doesn't have a country.

00:45:48.246 --> 00:45:50.081
You said you wanted to ask me something.

00:46:02.385 --> 00:46:03.552
It's about…

00:46:06.055 --> 00:46:07.640
the man who murdered Junik.

00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:13.521
You heard the last thing he said, right?

00:46:14.146 --> 00:46:15.481
Junik.

00:46:15.564 --> 00:46:17.441
Junik! Honey!

00:46:24.282 --> 00:46:26.367
I killed the spy.

00:46:34.458 --> 00:46:36.294
"I killed the spy," he said.

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:46.429
People say that the man was crazy.

00:46:49.515 --> 00:46:50.808
But his voice…

00:46:52.852 --> 00:46:54.103
his eyes.

00:46:57.064 --> 00:46:59.984
Every single night I think about it.

00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:02.278
And I feel more sure.

00:47:03.988 --> 00:47:05.489
That he wasn't crazy.

00:47:07.658 --> 00:47:11.203
Mr. Paik, you saw him a lot
closer than I did.

00:47:12.747 --> 00:47:14.874
So you're the only person that I can ask.

00:47:16.375 --> 00:47:20.504
I don't believe that Mr. Kim was,
uh, crazy or lying. But I do think…

00:47:21.464 --> 00:47:24.091
I do think that there was someone else
pulling the strings.

00:47:33.601 --> 00:47:34.727
"Wake up…"

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:36.645
This man is Mr. Kim.

00:47:38.147 --> 00:47:40.066
And I've watched this over and over again,

00:47:41.317 --> 00:47:43.903
wondering if I could've stopped it
if I got there sooner.

00:47:43.986 --> 00:47:45.488
…This is the word of the Lord.

00:47:45.571 --> 00:47:48.032
And then,
I noticed something strange here.

00:47:53.412 --> 00:47:54.622
What did he put in there?

00:48:11.931 --> 00:48:13.099
What is this?

00:48:18.187 --> 00:48:20.856
I tried to call this number,
but it was out of service.

00:48:22.483 --> 00:48:25.820
There were people who
clearly wanted to know who made the call.

00:48:25.903 --> 00:48:27.863
All right, let's move.

00:48:30.199 --> 00:48:33.494
I looked into it, and it turns
out that number was never in use.

00:48:34.954 --> 00:48:38.082
So whoever's card it is, well,
they must have the ability

00:48:39.125 --> 00:48:40.876
to erase phone records.

00:48:41.377 --> 00:48:43.003
That, or they're able to use

00:48:43.838 --> 00:48:45.714
whatever caller ID they want.

00:48:49.176 --> 00:48:50.511
Madam President.

00:48:56.308 --> 00:48:59.311
Seo Munju, how much can you trust her?

00:49:05.443 --> 00:49:06.777
What is it, Director?

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:26.881
Look at this.

00:49:27.631 --> 00:49:30.426
I checked all the CCTV footage
from the church,

00:49:30.509 --> 00:49:31.802
and here's what I found.

00:50:03.709 --> 00:50:05.294
That's my husband's brother.

00:50:06.045 --> 00:50:07.505
So, Junsang…

00:50:08.839 --> 00:50:10.591
met with Sergeant Kim that day.

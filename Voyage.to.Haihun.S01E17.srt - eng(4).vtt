00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.430
They'll come pick us up early tomorrow.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.430
So everyone, rest early tonight.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.790
Do you have unique local food here?

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.460
Rest assured, milord.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.590
I'll keep my eyes on him.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.190
Go to Chang'an on your own.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.330
Don't be mad at Yan Yannian.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.200
Who's Yan Yannian?

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.240
Xu Qingge's father.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.330
No matter what happens,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.280
stay at your mansion.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.920
- I'll come for you, remember?
- Mm.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.310
You two help him go over it.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.230
I'll head off first.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.070
Oh.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.940
I'm Wang Heng. I've been expecting you.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.120
Lord Wang, Lord Huo is looking for you.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.380
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.190
It never hurts to arrive early.

(Court of Judicial Review)
You must be Li Guang.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.150
I am indeed.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.110
I wish to discuss Lord Huo with you.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.480
Lord Wang, please come inside.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.990
After you.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.120
- What are you doing?
- Lord Wang.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.010
This drink will help you on your way.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.240
Take your misdeeds

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.870
with you to the underworld.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.100
(July 2 - June 25)

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.150
Help! Someone, please!

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.870
After him, now!

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.990
- Lord Wang.
- Traitor Wang Heng.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.140
Finish compiling that blacklist. Now!

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.350
What blacklist?

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.540
You challenge Great General Huo?

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.570
Wang Heng, you plotted treason.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.440
It is beyond pardon.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.310
Do as you please

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.630
if you want to kill me.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.470
For your service to Duke of Changyi,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.600
Lord Huo shows magnanimity

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.560
and spares your life.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.530
Guards, carry out castration.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.840
No! End my life instead!

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.500
(June 28 - June 25)

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.400
My apologies.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.750
Sorry for falling asleep.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:03.910
Ah, the youth.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:04.750
Good sleep quality.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.970
Lord Xiahou, I will speak

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:06.370
plainly.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.860
Let's unseat

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:07.310
Huo Guang.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.080
That's nonsense.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.590
Forget it.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.230
Lord Wang.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.440
Let's find a quiet place.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.290
Greetings, milord.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.030
And you are?

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.710
I am Xu Guanghan,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.660
used to work in Changyi.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.840
Show him out.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.090
Huo Guang is a sly

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.280
holdover from two reigns.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.840
Will you join me in bringing him down?

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.010
What?

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.870
Who is that?

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.560
Father, this man is plotting treason.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.400
Huh?

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.720
Haha.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.760
Do you have unique local...

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.120
Hey!

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.210
Stop talking, just get in.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.360
Fan Mingyou, Han Zeng, cross.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.530
Zhao Chongguo, cross. Zhang Anshi, cross.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.470
Lu Wenshu, Li Guang, Huang Ba, circle.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.520
Hyah!

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.080
Hyah!

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.470
Whoa!

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.270
Everyone, keep this in mind.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.000
You must follow the rules of the court.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.240
Once you enter the Palace,

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.940
you may not come and go freely.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.100
Not allowed...

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.030
Eh? Lord Wang.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.310
What is this about?

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.840
You must eat well.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.100
Who can protect you when I'm not around?

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.000
Heng.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.160
What's the matter?

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.670
Heng.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.340
(List)

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.160
Xiahou Sheng circle, Zhang Anshi cross.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.350
Xu Guanghan tick, Yang Chang circle.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.040
Yan Yannian tick,
Marquis Du, Tu Qitang tick.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.070
Tian Guangming cross.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.920
How did you know I drafted this list?

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.180
Heng.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.640
Heng.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.040
Heng.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.150
Heng.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:47.780
Heng!

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.390
This doesn't seem like a mere chill.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.640
Lord Wang hasn't eaten or drunk for days.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.470
Can his body endure that?

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.520
Heng.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.090
Is there anything you feel like eating?

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.950
Tell me if you want something.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.950
Duke, he...

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.110
To...

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.890
Tomato...

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.880
Eg...

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.200
Egg.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:36.780
What is this thing?

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.440
To...
[*To: West]

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.330
Tomato...
[*Tomato: red persimmon]

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.360
Egg.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.120
Wha... what is this thing?

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:47.510
I know egg

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.350
and persimmon.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:50.710
Lord Gong.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:51.860
You are truly learned.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.800
So, what exactly is a tomato?

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.120
Tomato...

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:01.650
Duke.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.030
A red persimmon from the Western Market.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.210
Lord Gong, you really know these things.

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.050
Such trouble.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.160
It must be from the Western Market.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.830
Fresh steamed bun for sale.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:23.990
Come take a look.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.330
Fresh steamed bun.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.440
No fresh persimmons today?

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.740
We only have dried ones this season.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.130
Buy it or move along.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.060
Don't touch everything.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.920
You really are...

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.780
Qi.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.230
Xu Qingge.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.720
Xu Qingge.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.760
How are you?

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.970
I'll now issue my first imperial decree:

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.770
Never do such foolish things again.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.170
You're not enthroned
and already so haughty.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.360
What will you be like by then?

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.100
This little cat is adorable.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.320
What's its name?

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.830
Her name is Xiao'an.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.580
I picked her for your Empress Mother.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.320
She loves kittens.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.600
Ow.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.060
It's only been a few days apart,

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.120
yet you're as close as sisters.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:14.800
That's right.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.870
And you're my nephew.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.890
You're taking advantage of me.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.720
Good nephew, let me have one of those.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.910
No way.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.770
These are ingredients
I'm going to cook with.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.050
Then I will taste your cooking, nephew.

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:48.590
Your father was worried
when you went missing.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.510
Maybe send him a word?

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.750
He never cared for me

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:54.750
when I was in Changyi.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:56.590
It's too late for him to care now.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:02.630
Did you make this dish yourself?

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:03.680
Mm.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.830
What's this dish called?

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.390
Tomato...

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:11.630
Egg...

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.000
Tomato Egg.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.330
So that's how you see it?

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.960
I sought Lord Gong's advice for this.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.430
The ripest persimmons
in the Western Market.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.200
Fresh eggs laid this morning.

00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:36.830
Wang is awake.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.200
What day is it?

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:43.960
How long was I asleep?

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.490
For two full days.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.510
I was afraid you might never wake.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.800
Heng.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:21.960
Heng.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:24.820
Tomato Egg.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:26.440
I made it myself.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.630
Is this even edible?

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.140
(Wucheng Village)

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:54.390
How's this blade?

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.090
Perfect. They're twin blades after all.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.320
It's the Moonfall Blades.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.120
Every edge carries the power of the skies.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.200
Your grandmaster sought out

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.790
the finest craftsmen

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.180
and forged it
from the rarest meteoric iron.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.370
Years ago, your master and I each held one

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.670
and sought our fortune

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:10.510
in the martial world.

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:11.710
And now,

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.120
I will give you mine as well.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:14.720
When the twin blades unite,

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.580
they serve to protect

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:16.570
and uphold the justice.

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:18.270
I entrust you with the future

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.550
of the whole village.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.120
Such a deep connection.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.080
I won't fail your trust.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.080
Go now.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:43.710
On this journey, be sure to tell Liu He,

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:45.690
if he agrees to what we request,

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.550
all of us will leave this place

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:48.960
to serve with all our strength.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.320
Hyah!

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.040
Wang.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.360
You really uncovered their identities.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.870
Thanks to the Duke's careful work.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.790
Without Qingge,

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.640
I wouldn't have compiled this list.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:18.230
Heng.

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:19.320
Mm.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.760
If we really go by your mark,

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.390
no general in Chang'an
is willing to help us.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.120
I only use this list

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.680
to bluff the court officials.

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:29.030
As for those military ones,

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:30.910
they collude up and down the ranks.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.280
Their ties are deep,

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.320
each acting without fear.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:36.490
What?

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.640
I'm the Emperor, and I can't even

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:39.920
command the troops?

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:41.920
In name, you are the Emperor.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.240
But in truth,

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.140
every single soldier of the court

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.390
answers only to Huo Guang.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:49.670
That is what currently

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.680
troubles us the most.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:54.070
Alas.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:00.850
Senior.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:04.630
You're back.

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.390
My martial uncle and his men
are skilled fighters,

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:10.550
supporting the Crown Prince.

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:13.320
Due to their ties with witchcraft,

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.640
they had to flee from the court's forces,

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:17.430
living in constant fear,

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.440
always on the move.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.950
They had to live incognito
in Wucheng Village.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.630
Village Chief Ren Xuan is your martial uncle.

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:28.240
Duke, once you ascend the throne,

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.750
could you grant them proper titles,

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:32.750
so they may live in peace?

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.450
If they're willing to help,

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.000
then it's naturally no trouble.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.510
There's one more matter.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.870
Go on.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:45.720
My martial uncle has risked his life

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:47.610
all for the Crown Prince.

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.210
Duke, could you grant him...

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:52.470
Of course.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.250
After all, he's of the Liu Clan.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.340
It's right to grant him a title and land.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:04.640
To bring down Huo Guang,

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.540
Uncle and his men
should be inside the Palace.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.600
But for now, they're just martial artists.

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:10.950
They lack a reason.

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:15.280
Then we'll replace the pillars.

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:19.860
We'll have

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:21.800
our people from Changyi

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.790
swap with the warriors

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:26.240
of Wucheng Village.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.920
The court approves the entry of my men

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.460
for teaching proper conduct.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:32.630
But in truth,

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:35.070
it's just a way to confine them.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.390
So what's the point

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:37.240
of this replacement?

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.750
I was furious at first.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:40.840
But right now,

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:42.590
I have my men inside the Palace.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:44.490
That replacement

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.050
has a chance naturally.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:49.460
If we want to make it,

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:51.200
we need the Empress Dowager.

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:53.000
To gain Her Majesty's help,

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.270
we must count on...

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:57.800
you.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.110
Your Majesty.

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:01.920
You're as close as sisters.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.630
She is surrounded by many attendants.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:04.880
Why not ask for her help?

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.870
Your Majesty.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.540
I just miss my father

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:11.330
and my grandfather.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.120
Then perhaps…

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:14.600
Take a stroll outside?

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:17.360
She entered the Palace long ago.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.200
Later, her clan was implicated
in Liu Dan's rebellion.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.590
And Huo Guang had them executed.

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:24.390
Huo Guang was her maternal grandfather,

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:26.120
but in her heart,

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:27.670
there must be resentment.

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:29.280
Your Majesty, Empress Dowager.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.720
We've reported all pressing matters of late.

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:34.840
We await your judgment.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.180
You've worked hard. The matters you reported,

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.080
I'm already aware of.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:39.210
The affairs of the state

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:41.200
require all of you to work together

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.200
to find the best course.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.770
We will obey...

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:44.630
Grandfather.

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:53.080
I humbly ask for a favor.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.980
What do you command, Your Majesty?

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.300
We are all ears and await your word.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:04.900
The Late Emperor's funeral is coming.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.040
Every time I think of it,

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:09.080
my heart feels bound and heavy.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.150
Though the Palace is of splendor,

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.730
it cannot veil the loneliness.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.940
I wish...

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.590
I wish to leave here for a bit

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:19.560
to clear my mind.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:21.300
It may ease my sorrow a little.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:22.840
Your Majesty,

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.550
during the mourning period,

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.600
leaving the Palace

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.660
is no small matter.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:29.750
I fear the unrest beyond the gates

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.370
and cannot fully ensure your safety.

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:35.620
Moreover, your safety is most precious

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.650
and should not be put at risk lightly.

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:39.790
I'll bring more guards with me.

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:44.360
Every corner here holds
remnants of the past.

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:46.300
The Late Emperor is gone.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.650
And I'm left all alone.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:50.480
All the memories of the past

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.950
come at me day after day.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.390
I truly…

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.280
truly…

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.150
Milords.

00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:58.910
You've worked hard today.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.600
Please go and rest now.

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:03.470
Yes.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.360
From now on,

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.120
in front of the officials,

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.240
you only address me as Great General.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.750
I admit my mistake.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:38.670
Hurry and clean up.

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:40.850
Here, and over there too.

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:42.750
Make sure it's spotless.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:55.530
Qingge.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.320
I made it.

♪Fatal danger turned into a jest♪

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:14.500
♪Through this road,
I watch the endless rise and fall♪

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:16.620
♪In the chapters lie ages
of decay and bloom♪

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.540
♪Let us meet again♪

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:23.740
♪One hurried path, and one at ease♪

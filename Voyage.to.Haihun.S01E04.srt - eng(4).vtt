(Duke of Changyi's Manor)
Beautiful lanterns!

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.960
Duke, what are you doing?

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.790
Oh? Wearing a mask for the match?

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.560
If the riders knew
I was competing in person,

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.980
how would they give their all?

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.990
Well.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.760
I shall first ride masked

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.350
and reveal my identity

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.760
after the race is done.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.180
Wouldn't that be quite the tale
for all to speak of?

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.580
I haven't agreed to let you
leave the city for the race yet.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.560
Isn't it bound to happen?

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.070
I heard if you're in the top three,

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.740
you can compete
with a mysterious figure.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.960
Who is this mysterious figure?

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.030
Well...

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.920
It's said to be someone
respected in Changyi.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.050
It could even be the Duke.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.620
Get back to your work.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.720
Two strings of five-zhu coins.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.380
One silver ingot.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:17.790
Lord Wang.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.080
The voting results are out.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.280
Xu Qingge ranks first among the riders.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.120
Xu Pingjun takes second place.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.560
Is the list completely tallied?

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.430
Yeah.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.910
I don't think so.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.270
Here.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.680
Lord Wang, what's this about?

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.430
Since everyone's so fired up,

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.080
as the event organizer,

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.980
we can't just stand by and watch, right?

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.340
I'll have to join the race myself.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.400
Oh, I see.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.710
Lord Wang, ten votes.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:44.840
Yes, Lord Wang.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.000
Now, that's enough to qualify.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.910
Good.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.870
Lord Wang.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.960
Here's our roster. Please have a look.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.640
Hold it higher.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.750
Be smart.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.030
Who put it like this?

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.970
Who can see from here?

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.030
Well.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.910
This, this, this.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.020
And this one.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.690
It lacks

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.150
some feelings.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.200
Do you get me?

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.570
Can you make the title bigger
yet somehow a bit smaller?

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.150
Go, find me the best artist you can.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.240
I have another meeting.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.270
When I'm back,

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.770
I want to see eight versions.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.890
Eight versions?

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.190
What to do?

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.030
I heard that Li from the street corner

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.430
booked the entire racetrack.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.910
By the time I tried to book it,
it was too late.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.750
Not too late.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:36.630
Really?

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.840
I actually want

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.280
the prime ad spot on the horse today.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.240
After all, the space is fixed.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.710
But the horse is alive and moving.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:43.590
Still not here yet?

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.540
- Where's he?
- Yeah.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.240
- Right?
- Everyone.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.520
Please, calm down.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.880
Lord Wang will be here any moment.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.720
Thank you for waiting.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:52.750
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.080
At last, you're here.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.870
The previous meeting ran long.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.870
Shall we begin?

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:58.960
Come, come.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.840
May I speak now?

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.680
Go ahead.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.800
Everyone,

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.310
this is

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.000
the ad space I've prepared

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.470
for our esteemed patrons.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.680
All prime spots for display.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.080
Take a look here.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.910
The horse's neck,

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.220
the horse's belly,

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.390
and the most expensive spot here,

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.200
which is called

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.720
the Flattery Seat.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.240
The Flattery Seat?

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.920
Advertising on a horse's rear?

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.800
Isn't that a bad omen?

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.070
Exactly.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:30.800
Oh, dear.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.890
Don't underestimate that spot.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.240
It is

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.120
a profound art.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.160
Profound? How?

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.270
Care to enlighten us?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.750
It's profound

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.840
because it's big.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.360
Alright, alright.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.520
Any generous patron here

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.160
wants to take the Flattery Seat?

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.400
I'll offer 200 qian.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.400
200!

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.480
- 500!
- 500.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.840
- 600!
- 600!

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.240
- 800!
- 900! 900!

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.080
Oh.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.000
Gentlemen there.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.560
Anyone offering more than 1000?

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.430
1100!

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.310
1200!

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.390
Everyone, don't rush.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.360
Calm yourselves.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.480
Lord Wang will be here any moment.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:09.590
Where is he?

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:11.950
Listen to me.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.430
Here he comes!

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.270
Why the urgency?

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.590
They can't get the VVIP tickets.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.800
So, they're making a ruckus.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.800
Why not release more VVIP tickets?

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.640
Exactly.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:24.580
That's right.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.190
We have money.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.130
Why can't we buy them?

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.260
Yes, why can't we buy them?

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:30.360
Exactly.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.800
Everyone, quiet down.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.040
Hear me out.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.060
What is a VIP?

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.240
An honored guest.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.190
And what is a VVIP?

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.420
A guest of unmatched honor.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.070
If I just add more tickets,

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.800
I'd be offending these VVIP guests.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.070
I cannot afford that.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.390
We all pay for our tickets.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.190
It has nothing to do with offense.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.670
- Exactly.
- Right.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.000
Friends, listen up.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.270
Let me be frank with you.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.190
Every single VVIP ticket

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.750
was bought up by the Duke.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.040
And they decided the number.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.750
I truly can't add more.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.190
Why should they get to buy them all?

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.270
However,

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.120
I never expected you
to be so enthusiastic.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.800
As the organizer, I'm truly heartened.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.920
Today,

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.560
even if it means taking a great risk,

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.720
I'll make sure
to bring the ticket prices down.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.430
If you can't get VVIP tickets,

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.760
I'll give VIP tickets at half price.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.880
Great!

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.560
Oh, my goodness.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.120
Milord.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.160
You mustn't do this!

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.510
Please, rise.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.160
Milord.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.430
These ticket prices

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.480
were set by the Duke.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.410
If you change it without permission,

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.540
you'll be deceiving the Duke!

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.500
Even so,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.350
I must secure
some benefits for my family.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.660
Great, great.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.510
In that case,

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.600
I'd be your accomplice.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.960
That's punishable by beheading.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.600
They are all my family.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.560
If they don't speak up,

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.720
how would the Duke ever know?

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:54.920
Exactly.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.830
Do you not trust my family?

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.870
Yes, yes, of course.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.970
Milord, please think twice.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.560
In that case,

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.920
I'll cover the cost for the benefits

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.190
for my family.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.400
Oh, my.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.430
My dear family.

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.120
Place your orders right now,

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.390
and enjoy the best deal I can offer.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.360
Three, two, one.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:22.670
On sale.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:24.440
(Fifty tickets left for today)
On sale!

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.420
I'll take one.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:26.800
Give me one.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.160
I want five.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.080
Got it!

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.070
Got it!

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.600
Pass me the biscuit.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.440
Oh.

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:34.750
The gold biscuit.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:35.600
The gold biscuit.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.550
Oh.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.440
Heng.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:40.600
What brings you here?

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.900
Something important to discuss.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.150
Another meeting?

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.070
I've been in meetings since the morning.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.510
Another meeting without lunch?

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:48.480
No.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.080
Go to the Duke's mansion.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:51.760
The officials want to see me?

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.220
You've achieved
remarkable results lately.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.630
I didn't expect you
to possess such extraordinary talent

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.380
at such a young age.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.000
Truly a blessing for our people.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.370
I used to think that I had made

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:08.900
- Let me.
- a mistake.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.470
Lord Gong, you...

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:17.950
You flatter me.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:20.650
This is but my duty.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:22.220
It's hardly worth mentioning.

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:26.740
Earlier, the Duke discussed with me

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.480
holding the finals of the horse race
outside the city.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.890
I've made all the arrangements.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:34.980
(At last, it's settled.)

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.630
Thanks to the Duke.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.080
Thanks for your kindness, Lord Gong.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.080
I am truly delighted.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.440
I am truly delighted.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.320
Ha ha ha.

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:48.560
Lord Wang, since you're busy,

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:51.510
I won't keep you here any longer.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.120
Then I'll just

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.440
take my leave.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:57.710
Alright.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.630
I'll visit you another day.

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:02.630
You'll be most welcome.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.390
(Wang Heng is no ordinary man.)

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.550
Hey, Heng, he agreed?

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:24.430
Yes.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.150
We can have a horse race
outside the city?

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.000
That's right.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:27.930
Hey.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.180
Why didn't you come with me?

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:30.640
I was so nervous on my own.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:31.920
It's such an important matter.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.630
How could I discuss it with Lord Gong?

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.960
But you can meet the Duke.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.320
Why not

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.120
introduce me to him?

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:39.960
Well?

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:41.670
The Duke is still locked away.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.870
None of us can see him.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:44.320
I'll practice horse riding now.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:45.220
Hey.

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:47.630
Lord Gong has agreed.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.460
Let them handle the rest from here.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.080
As for us,

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:53.790
we need a solid plan.

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:55.630
Why not drink

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.870
while we talk?

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:57.710
No way.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.200
Practice comes first.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:00.510
We can talk later.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.270
If the plan's ready,
what's the point of a race?

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.220
It's just an extra fuss.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.040
Regardless,

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:05.910
let's fuss first.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:13.270
Oh, my.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.320
Wang.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:18.960
Training so hard, are you?

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:20.170
Hey.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:21.880
Don't even bring it up.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.070
How could anyone eat this?

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.630
This is already not bad.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.150
(If only I could hear a little tune)

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.420
(and sip some wine)

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.080
(with a bit of fried chicken.)

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.620
(Qingge Tavern)

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:50.390
Brothers.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.030
Our grand plan is about to succeed.

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:53.510
Everything is ready.

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:56.270
Tonight,

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.790
we drink till dawn without stopping.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:10:59.950
No one goes home sober.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.270
No one goes home sober!

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:02.440
Big...

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.480
Big? Big what?

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:05.330
Big what?

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.510
I already told you.

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:08.230
When we're outside,

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.030
you should call me...

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:10.880
Qi.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.790
Right.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:12.960
Call me Qi.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:14.590
You were wrong.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.870
Drink.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.870
Come on.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:20.510
What's wrong?

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:22.590
Careful.

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:24.110
Oh.

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:25.890
Great.

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:29.790
I can't hold it.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.080
Zhang.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.840
I'm going to the privy.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:34.900
Go quickly.

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:36.000
Hurry back.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.730
Where's Li Qi?

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.040
I'll go back to practice.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.000
Wang.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.690
Is this really necessary?

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.630
I'll race with the Duke.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.430
I have to be able to keep up.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.120
The Duke? A race?

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:57.160
That's right.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.200
That's not right.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.540
The Duke isn't joining the race.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.310
Aren't we supposed

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.850
to use the race to make our escape?

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:03.920
Where's Qi Chang?

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.040
Huh?

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:06.360
Go, go, go!

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.320
Hurry, hurry!

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:08.480
Take the Duke with us!

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.320
No, no, wait.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.550
Qi, let's go!

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.280
Go!

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.080
No, no, take the back door!

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.030
Back door! Back door!

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:16.710
Hey.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.200
Stop grabbing the wine!

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:21.670
Go.

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.080
This carriage is going way too fast.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:23.920
Slow down.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:25.240
You've had fun, huh?

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.080
You sure run fast.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.600
This young lady...

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:32.240
She's quite the beauty.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.820
Anyone who came to support tonight

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:38.390
will be rewarded.

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:40.120
- I...
- Come on.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.080
- Qi Chang.
- We...

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.620
I can't see the Duke at the race.

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:45.040
Why have you put me in it?

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.160
And why did you try to escape
during the race?

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.110
Well.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:58.680
Come on.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.440
Come on!

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.360
Let me tell you something.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:08.830
You've come at just the right time.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:09.840
Now that you're here,

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:12.600
I can get on the carriage.

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:14.260
- Get on!
- I...

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.200
Stop it!

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.200
Hey.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.150
Stop it!

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:21.030
Move aside!

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.870
Stop!

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.000
Are you really leaving on your own?

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:24.830
Do you have money?

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.890
Do you even know the way?

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:26.780
Can you leave the city?

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.040
Yes.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.480
I lied to you.

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.120
The Duke will not join the race.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.560
Well now.

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:37.760
No more pretending.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.080
The truth is out.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.590
But there's a reason for it.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:42.840
Lord Gong assigned a task to the Duke.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.890
If he wishes to leave the city
for the race,

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.780
he must handle the horse affairs.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:49.880
None of that

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:51.070
has anything

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.470
to do with me.

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.000
You deceived me.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.080
That's what truly matters.

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:00.110
That's right.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.240
If I were you, I'd be even angrier.

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.830
It's my fault
for oversimplifying things.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.080
All I wanted was to escape with you.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.880
I had it all planned out.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.480
We'd use the horse race

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.750
to leave the city.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.160
You couldn't ride, right?

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.460
Meeting the Duke was just a pretext,

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.290
so you could train your riding

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:20.750
and keep up with me.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:23.960
Heng,

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.480
please understand my position.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.670
I couldn't tell you the whole truth.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.550
But you simply can't see the Duke.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:36.240
And I betrayed the Duke
to leave with you.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:37.750
I'm sincere.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:38.920
Believe it or not.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.390
Oh.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.650
I just can't figure it out.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.240
What's so special about seeing the Duke?

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.550
Doesn't he just show up

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.410
to present an award?

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.840
You care about things like that?

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:51.510
(You don't know a thing.)

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.270
Are you saying

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.270
the Duke will present the prize

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:57.550
on the day of the race?

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:58.390
That's right.

00:14:58.750 --> 00:14:59.590
Good.

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:01.110
That's exactly what I care about.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:02.510
Once I meet the Duke,

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.080
I can get things done.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.180
What things?

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:08.410
It has nothing to do with you.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:10.920
Go on.

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:12.320
What's the plan?

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:15.030
So,

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:16.080
you agreed?

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:17.110
Of course.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.670
I've had it all planned.

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:21.230
You are

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.390
the son of the Qilin,

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:24.910
and I'm the Chosen One.

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:26.640
Once the horse affairs are settled,

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:28.120
we'll slip away from Changyi,

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:29.200
ride together to Chang'an,

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:29.910
reclaim the Qilin,

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:30.970
and see our wish fulfilled.

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:32.070
Wouldn't that be thrilling?

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:33.510
(Huh.)

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.510
(Once I meet Liu He,)

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:35.710
(I'll abandon you.)

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:36.600
(Fool.)

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.200
Mm, well.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.160
Not bad.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.280
Mm.

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.740
(Chang'an, Yuanping Year 1)

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:46.140
(Emperor Zhao of Han)
(On the 5th of the 6th month, 74 BC,)

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:49.260
- (in the flourishing age,)
- I believe the Duke of Guangling,

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:51.580
- (a major event arose.)
- the fourth son of Emperor Wu,

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:54.200
- (The current ruler)
- the late Emperor's only full brother,

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.410
- (suddenly passed away.)
- should inherit the throne.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.740
(Emperor Zhao of Han, Liu Fuling)

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.860
- (reigned for 13 years,)
- The Duke of Guangling is

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:02.790
- (and passed away at 21.)
- good at governance.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.440
- (He left no heirs)
- The late Emperor favored him.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.170
- (or an imperial decree,)
- The Duke of Guangling is most fitting.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.050
(except for the 15-year-old
Empress Shangguan.)

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.030
Seconded.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.800
(Empress Shangguan)
Seconded.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:13.770
(Thus,)

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:15.810
- (who should ascend the throne)
- Seconded.

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:19.500
- (became the greatest dilemma.)
- Seconded.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.910
The Duke of Guangling acts
without any regard for rules.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:33.790
There are also rumors,

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:37.120
saying he's been mingling
in secret with a witch.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.340
Such a man may not be a wise choice.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.750
The Duke of Guangling
is that sort of man?

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:45.610
I did hear whispers about this
in years past.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.670
Who should we choose then?

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.360
Well...

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.910
(Huo Guang, Great General)

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:52.080
Empress Dowager,

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:55.670
I have received a memorial here.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.250
Please grant it your reading.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:15.590
Everyone,

00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:17.750
Duke Tai of Zhou

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:19.200
and Duke Wen of Zhou

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.270
set aside the eldest son

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:24.070
and chose the most virtuous
for the sake of the realm.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.030
Now that we gather here to decide

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:28.480
the heir to inherit the throne,

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.240
we must first weigh character
and ability.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.030
How can we be bound
by rigid rites and laws?

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:34.880
Besides,

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:38.680
when Emperor Wu was still alive,

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.790
he didn't name

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.550
the Duke of Guangling as Crown Prince.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.960
If you act like this,

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:47.680
are you going
against Emperor Wu's final wish?

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:56.590
Lord Huo,

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.880
as for the choice of successor,

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:00.280
I believe

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:01.740
you must have

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:03.560
given it careful thought.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.970
Liu He, Duke of Changyi,

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.750
is the grandson of Emperor Wu,

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.510
born in the hometown
of Confucius and Mencius

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.640
and raised in the way of Confucianism.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.160
If he were to inherit the throne,

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.380
what would you all say to that?

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.780
